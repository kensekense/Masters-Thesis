1
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,282
Everyone get close to everyone
so you can touch someone.

2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,411
This is very serious. It's more
serious than you can imagine.

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Let's pray.

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,333
Father, we thank you for...

5
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,503
just being our God, and
for all that you do.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,714
We thank you for this day, and...

7
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,467
we thank you for the chill
in this air, Father.

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,094
Because we thank you
for the sunshine,

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,972
because you create the chill
and you create the sunshine.

10
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,392
And you know these are
tough times, Father.

11
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,729
We're asking this morning
for your guidance.

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,690
- Amen.
- Amen.

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,820
We stand here today, with
a plant that's closing,

14
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,615
with a... a deep,
rich history, and,

15
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,421
it's sad for me and, I'm sure,

16
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,661
everybody else in
there to see it go,

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,953
but I will say this:

18
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,999
I'm extremely proud of the people
that work in this plant here.

19
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,168
There's none better.

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,670
They know how to get the job done.

21
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,942
- How old are these houses?
- Two hundred years?

22
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,487
No way. America was founded
only 200 years ago.

23
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,655
Oh.

24
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,866
- Then at least several decades.
- Yeah, maybe.

25
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,496
- Cold?
- Yeah.

26
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,683
But this is really beautiful.

27
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah, gorgeous.

28
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,630
See, America's airspace
is really busy.

29
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,007
There's one.

30
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,634
And there.

31
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,650
When you take a look
at an automobile,

32
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,994
you see glass all around it.

33
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,954
That's what we do.

34
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,707
We have about 70% of the market.

35
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,168
Okay? Which is pretty extensive.

36
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,795
We have facilities
around the world,

37
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,758
throughout China, United States
now, with our plant here.

38
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,887
What we're doing is we're
melding two cultures together:

39
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,598
the Chinese culture
and the US culture.

40
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,560
So we are truly a
global organisation.

41
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,690
So, we do have three
different shifts

42
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,273
right now that we
are working with.

43
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,277
A first, second, and a
third. Pretty traditional.

44
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,695
You'll also have a
30-minute unpaid lunch.

45
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,406
Plus, there's two
15-minute paid breaks.

46
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,951
Plenty of opportunities,
ladies and gentlemen.

47
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,536
Plenty of opportunities.

48
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,623
Is this a union shop?

49
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,916
We are not.

50
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,168
It is our desire to not be.

51
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,130
But we recognise
that, one, we need

52
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,965
to do things right by employees.

53
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay? We recognise that.

54
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,795
I have, actually, 28
years experience.

55
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:30,796
Very good.

56
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:33,976
Payroll, human resources,
operations, things like that.

57
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,290
I have a master's in mechanical
engineering too, so...

58
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,291
Okay, good. Super.

59
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,704
Sounds like you got a
lot of good skills.

60
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,042
Well, I... Actually, I've worked

61
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,388
in all kinds of
different levels of...

62
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,389
Yeah? Okay, good.

63
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,537
What we'll do is we'll take a
look at your résumé. All right?

64
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,928
Where you sit today used to
be a General Motors plant.

65
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,013
This plant closed,

66
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,475
leaving 2,000 families unemployed.

67
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,939
And now, there are over 1,000
employees working here,

68
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,774
with still more to be hired.

69
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,740
It was a little over two years ago
that this facility was a very dark

70
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,578
and very stark reminder of the
greatest economic downturn

71
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,080
in American history since
the Great Depression.

72
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,928
And with that, you
understand the...

73
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,752
the personal impact that that has,

74
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,173
individually and for the
families of all those involved.

75
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,430
It's been a very fast process
from the very beginning.

76
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,099
When I hired in, there was
nothing in the plant.

77
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,227
And since that time, you can
see, in the last six months,

78
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,855
the amount of people and
equipment that have come in.

79
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,940
And it's, exciting.

80
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,526
The commitment everybody's
put in, hard work.

81
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,488
We're looking forward
to starting production.

82
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,449
Since you've arrived in America,

83
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,017
I believe you've found
many things different

84
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,560
from life in China.

85
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,979
We need to get to know Americans.

86
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,276
America is a place to let
your personality run free.

87
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,779
As long as you're not
doing anything illegal,

88
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
you're free to follow your heart.

89
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,825
You can even joke
about the president.

90
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,036
Nobody will do anything to you.

91
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,374
Americans' cars are big and
huge, very comfortable.

92
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,587
This represents the American
sense of casualness.

93
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,132
They don't place a heavy
importance on outfits and attire.

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,719
If you travel in Europe
in the summertime,

95
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,181
and you see someone
walking in front of you,

96
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,977
if he's wearing shorts,
vests, and sports shoes,

97
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,521
they must be an American.

98
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,149
Americans say what they
are thinking directly.

99
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
They don't hide anything.

100
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,154
They are very obvious.

101
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,448
Everything is practical
and realistic.

102
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,536
They dislike abstractions and
theory in their daily lives.

103
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,331
Time is limited today,
so I won't keep going.

104
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,418
The list here is really long.

105
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,461
Wow, thank you.

106
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,841
As required by Chairman,

107
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,804
we will have an opening
celebration on October 7th.

108
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,973
From now on,

109
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,895
I ask you to keep
October 7th in mind

110
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,733
and work hard towards
this grand celebration.

111
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,257
Welcome, Chairman.
Good to see you.

112
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,395
This one is the Chevrolet S-10.

113
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
It was made in 1982.

114
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,319
That's the first one they made.

115
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,736
The first car from the GM plant.

116
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,405
Wow, Dayton was very well
developed back then?

117
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,200
Exactly. A very well
developed area.

118
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,803
"I have a secret to share, and
from the bottom of my heart,

119
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,806
I love Ohio, and I love the place

120
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
where I invest significantly,
here in Dayton."

121
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,271
This is a historic project that is
gonna help grow this community,

122
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:34,068
give people jobs, and give a
future to your kids and my kids

123
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,697
that did for those trucks
back there when our parents

124
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,450
and grandparents worked on
refrigerators and cars.

125
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,370
And the future is bright,
folks. The future is bright.

126
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,258
Please join me in acknowledging
the newly-named Fuyao Avenue.

127
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,409
"Good morning, everyone.
And we meet again today."

128
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:29,915
Every time I visit this plant,
I see a lot of changes.

129
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
"Every time when I visit,
I see great progress."

130
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,256
You see there's still empty
space for more equipment.

131
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,300
It will all be installed
within a year.

132
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,191
"If we can follow through with our
plan and become successful here,

133
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,067
this will be a great example

134
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,987
of the US successfully
attracting foreign investment."

135
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,131
Thank you very much.

136
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,573
"Thank you very much."

137
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,305
He says that a lot of people
lost their jobs in this area,

138
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,164
and he thanks you for
the opportunity.

139
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,476
And tell him, one time,
he has to come down here

140
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,918
and eat some barbecue with us.

141
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,298
- Okay.
- Thank you.

142
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,196
So the clients are satisfied?

143
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,972
Yes, very satisfied.
Especially Chrysler.

144
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,559
I am pairing an American
with a Chinese.

145
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,550
The American is the
main operator, with

146
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,230
a Chinese supervisor
by their side.

147
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,149
They're pretty slow.

148
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
They have fat fingers.

149
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,362
We keep training
them over and over.

150
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,745
How you doing?

151
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,105
The chairman has said from the

152
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,083
beginning this is an
American company.

153
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,586
It's Fuyao Glass America. It
needs to be an American company,

154
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,147
we need to treat it like
an American company,

155
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,948
but we need to be
successful just like

156
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:02,633
all our plants
throughout the world.

157
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,302
So, basically, this
line, that's the stage.

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,280
So from there back to the stage,

159
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,990
- and then people out that way.
- Facing that way.

160
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,558
- Yeah.
- We're talking, like,

161
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,644
a concert stage without cover

162
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,022
and potentially a
overhang for weather.

163
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,732
We're gonna have to plan for that.

164
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,630
You know what I mean?
Like, a concert...

165
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,076
Chairman thinks we're okay
with October weather,

166
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,846
so you don't need any hang.

167
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,246
- No hang.
- What if it rains?

168
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,331
It won't.

169
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,532
It won't.

170
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,884
In October, the weather
will be like it is today.

171
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,029
Chairman thinks, in October,
the weather will be similar

172
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
- to... today.
- Today?

173
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,201
Also, Chairman says that
door can't face this way.

174
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:55,202
What door?

175
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,842
Face... You know, the
opening right there.

176
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,649
Well, we just signed
a contract, so...

177
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,325
- What?
- That's a big...

178
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,940
You got to talk to Jimmy
about... I don't know.

179
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,945
I think it's...

180
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,379
Jimmy, do you understand
what he means?

181
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,841
We just did a purchase order and
ordered a garage door and stuff.

182
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,520
So, you got to face some
other direction, I think.

183
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,539
- So...
- They already put the door in.

184
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,417
So we're gonna have to
change it. Is that okay?

185
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
- Yeah, we need to change it.
- Okay.

186
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,629
Yeah, Z, just change it.

187
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,341
That's gonna cost us $35,000.

188
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,451
I have an idea, but I am
not sure it's a good one.

189
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,060
We hang two artworks here.

190
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,064
One is something iconic of China,

191
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,815
like the Great Wall.

192
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,653
- The other one is from the US.
- No. Only American ones.

193
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,196
Only American ones.

194
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,448
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

195
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
Don't upset them.

196
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,428
American, just...

197
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,413
They haven't done good
decorative work here.

198
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,624
This can't be here. It
should be moved to the side.

199
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,101
There are... It's required by law

200
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,853
to have one in here, and
it has to be that height.

201
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,021
They're just saying

202
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,424
that it should be
moved to the side.

203
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,297
- We can move it, yeah.
- Huh?

204
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,509
David says that is
the required height.

205
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,824
We can't place it down there.
It has to be that high.

206
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,225
We can move it to that corner.

207
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
Then up there.

208
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,062
It's a legal requirement.
I'll ask him.

209
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,065
He has to ask and see. He knows
this is the right height.

210
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,071
But sometimes, you have
to think, before you do,

211
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,448
so then we don't have
to redo the work,

212
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,908
because it costs money.

213
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,035
Yeah, I've... That was done...

214
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,703
I wouldn't have
necessarily moved, but

215
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,205
that was done way
before I got here.

216
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
Catch another big fish.

217
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,012
Did you all set the bait this way?

218
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,115
- Looks fucking cool.
- How do you set it?

219
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,683
You got the Fuyao employees
down here doing it.

220
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,560
- Oh, yeah?
- They all work at Fuyao.

221
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
- Fuyao or Fiyao?
- Fuyao.

222
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,980
Fiyao? Is that how
it's pronounced?

223
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,109
Fuyao. F-U-Y-A-O.

224
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,360
- Fuyao, Inc.
- Fuyao?

225
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,196
- Yes, Fuyao Company.
- What type of company is that?

226
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,909
Automotive glass. They
make the glass...

227
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,910
Yes, make glass.

228
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
- Oh, nice. Okay.
- The car glass.

229
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,121
- Okay, wow, glass.
- Yes.

230
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,491
Ooh, that's a big one right there.

231
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:22,957
- Big, yes.
- Very big.

232
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,586
- How speak English?
- Carp.

233
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,004
- Carp.
- Carp.

234
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,672
C-A-R-P. Carp.

235
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,717
- C-A-R-P. Carp. Carp.
- Yep. Those are carp.

236
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,635
Now, the carp that you're catching

237
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
- likes corn and Wheaties.
- Huh.

238
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,973
Have you heard of Wheaties cereal?

239
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,201
- I don't know. Wheaty...
- Never heard of Wheaties?

240
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,769
- Wheaties? I don't know.
- Wheaties.

241
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,645
- Wheaties.
- Wheaties.

242
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,441
Yeah, buddy. You'd be surprised
how good Wheaties works.

243
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
Wheaties? W-E-D-S?

244
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
W-E-E-T-E-S.

245
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,659
- No. I don't know that.
- Okay. Yup, it does the best.

246
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,963
Looks like they're getting
ready to go, huh?

247
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,249
We're going home to gut the
fish, and we'll come back.

248
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,877
All right, Leon. I'mma go home
and get me something to eat.

249
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,378
- I'll be back down.
- Okay, okay.

250
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,047
- I'll be back down.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,298
All right, Leon.

252
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
- Patty?
- Yes?

253
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,266
- I'm getting ready to leave.
- Okay.

254
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,643
- All right.
- Have a good day.

255
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,323
For a year and a half, I
didn't have anything.

256
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,914
When I started at Fuyao,

257
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,543
I was thankful, I was
blessed, I was...

258
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,255
just on my knees, thanking
God that I had something.

259
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,299
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

260
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,384
Going good.

261
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,802
- All right?
- Yeah.

262
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,683
This is the best game
in town right now.

263
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,231
Going back in there
for the first time,

264
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,150
I kind of welled up because...

265
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,735
I could see the post locations...

266
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,155
you know, on the
columns, you know?

267
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,907
Which actually tells you
where you are in the plant.

268
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,451
People still get lost. I
said, "I don't get lost."

269
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,715
At General Motors,
I was making $29

270
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
and some change an hour.

271
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,722
At Fuyao, I make 12.84.

272
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,190
Back then, if my kids wanted
a pair of new gym shoes,

273
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,359
I could just go get them.
I can't just do that now.

274
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,906
We lost our home,
we lost a vehicle.

275
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,408
- Have a good weekend.
- All right, you too.

276
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,754
When GM closed, I
foreclosed on my house.

277
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,674
Ever since then,

278
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,887
I have struggled to try to get
back to middle class again.

279
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,980
I've been living in
my sister's basement.

280
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,369
I am fortunate enough
to have a bedroom.

281
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,836
And the only thing in here
is my end tables and my TV.

282
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,839
The bed isn't mine.
The bed is theirs.

283
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,593
You know? So, yeah.

284
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,362
We've been down about... I
don't know, 45 minutes or so.

285
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,615
Water spots, I guess.

286
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,588
Thank you.

287
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,885
They've drained the washer.
They're slowing it down.

288
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,248
They get upset when we're all
trying to figure something out.

289
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,358
Everybody gets upset, and
then everybody's upset

290
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,443
in their own language,

291
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,070
and then everybody just
walks their own way, and...

292
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,323
meet back here in five minutes.

293
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,491
Set the water temperature to 60°.

294
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
Because it has high alkalinity.

295
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,956
Okay. Later on, we're going
to try to lower the...

296
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,588
Okay.

297
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,801
Be careful.

298
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,264
Beautiful. Beautiful.

299
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,974
Down a little.

300
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,058
Down a little bit.

301
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,661
This damn thing...

302
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,063
- Allen wrench.
- Allen. Allen.

303
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,230
Allen wrench.

304
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,858
- Allen wrench.
- Allen wrench.

305
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:50,202
My first impression of
Ohio was how flat it is.

306
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,123
My family's in China.

307
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,627
Two lovely children

308
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,254
and a beautiful wife.

309
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,429
Fuyao offered me my
first job at 18.

310
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,228
I've worked in the furnace
for more than 20 years.

311
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,106
It's a hard job, but I love it.

312
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,074
Because of the language barrier
and cultural differences,

313
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,955
it's hard to quickly
integrate everyone's ideas.

314
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,109
I don't have much time
to eat every day.

315
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,260
So every week, I bring
a box of Twinkies.

316
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
This is my lunch.

317
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,805
I eat two at a time.

318
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,401
Look at the red sticks.
This one is broken.

319
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,488
We have to pull it
out by ourselves.

320
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,159
Look at the scars on my arm.

321
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,411
These are all scalds.

322
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,912
I got burned.

323
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
Air.

324
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,713
Wong and I have spent a
lot of time together

325
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,631
with him teaching me everything...

326
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,429
Mother's Day, we spent the
whole weekend working together

327
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,348
with our little translators,
talking back and forth.

328
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,020
That's when they told me that
they had to be here two years,

329
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,272
away from their
family, no extra pay.

330
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,107
That really made me start thinking

331
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,068
and appreciating what they're
doing for us more and more.

332
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,698
I've ate at their house,
they've ate at my home.

333
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,033
We've just bonded.

334
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,369
And we've tried to learn
each other's culture.

335
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,833
I got the big idea,
Thanksgiving, to...

336
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,711
invite my close friends,

337
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,714
which should have been about
four or five of them.

338
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,967
It ended up being, I think, 13.

339
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,360
Bought a 25-pound
turkey, the biggest

340
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:15,931
honey-baked ham I could get,

341
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,225
and all of the
traditional trimmings.

342
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,479
I know that in China they're
not allowed to have guns.

343
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,691
We had my 12-gauge shotgun
out there, pistols.

344
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,241
Couple of the very
brave ones wanted

345
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:30,588
to go up and down the road with me

346
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,613
on my Harley.

347
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,992
They talked about it forever.

348
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,579
That made me happy.

349
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,126
That's the front page of The
Washington Post, fellas.

350
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,461
That's big-time.

351
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,217
The only negative thing that
I can see from this article

352
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,636
is that, out of our 2,000 people,

353
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,722
they picked the number one UAW...

354
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,685
organiser and
sympathiser to talk to.

355
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,768
Number one.

356
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,941
- Anyway, it's a big deal.
- That's a big deal.

357
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,442
With all of this scrutiny

358
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,846
and with all of this
visibility comes

359
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,738
even more responsibility on us

360
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,699
to do things right.

361
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,993
Now the whole world is watching.

362
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,954
Now the whole world
is watching us.

363
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,674
It should say have
"to be the world."

364
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,970
Yeah, they said they had an S.

365
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,262
Good afternoon.

366
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,286
- Right?
- Good afternoon.

367
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,685
Good afternoon.

368
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,391
Thank you guys very much.

369
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,709
You don't know how
important this is to Fuyao

370
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,294
and to the chairman.

371
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,005
The plant looks great.

372
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,632
These people are coming here

373
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,587
to see something
that they never in

374
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,511
their lifetime thought
would happen.

375
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,640
You have given hope and you
have given life to a community

376
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,558
that was desolate.

377
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,791
This is one of the
greatest projects

378
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,689
in the history of
the United States.

379
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,150
So, be proud, and
most importantly,

380
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,609
have fun.

381
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,777
Two lands,

382
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,136
the bridge is what
brings us together.

383
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:19,137
Yeah.

384
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:20,973
And the... How do
you say in English?

385
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,119
- The bond.
- Bond. Yeah, bond. Bond.

386
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,537
Yes, bond.

387
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,604
Welcome.

388
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,193
Welcome to the US.

389
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,333
Today the chairman's
vision has been fulfilled.

390
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,628
Fuyao has invested
close to 500 million.

391
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,892
Ni hao.

392
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,454
Really good seeing
you guys. Thank you.

393
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,646
Thanks for having us out here.
We really appreciate it.

394
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,832
- It's a big deal.
- Absolutely.

395
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,274
This is big. A lot of people.

396
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,109
- Nice weather, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

397
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,402
Chairman ordered the weather.

398
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,806
Oh, I mean, it couldn't be better.

399
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:42,321
- Right.
- Hang in there.

400
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,217
- How you doing, Dave?
- Good to see you.

401
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,326
Yeah, all right.

402
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,172
"My dear guests and
friends, good morning."

403
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:05,011
Today, we hold the
opening ceremony

404
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,138
of Fuyao Glass America.

405
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,121
We've heard both
candidates for president

406
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,105
refer to Ohio as the Rust Belt.

407
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,691
And, you know, you look
at... look at this today,

408
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
and we reject that term.

409
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,005
With Chairman Cao, we know how to
make everything in this state.

410
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,782
And, this is a terrific example.

411
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,742
One last point: I
know many workers

412
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,410
here are trying to form a union

413
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,871
to strengthen their voice
in this great company.

414
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,749
Ohio has a rich... a
rich, rich history

415
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,460
of unions and management
working together.

416
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,423
I support those in this community,
in this plant, in this crowd

417
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,927
that want to vote on whether
or not to join a union.

418
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,098
I hope Fuyao looks at it the
same way. Thank you all so much.

419
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,687
Who the fuck does he think he is?

420
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,106
Out of place, totally
out of place.

421
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,982
Fuck him.

422
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,485
Three, two, one.

423
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,077
Our glass is totally made in USA.

424
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,833
Ladies, you're doing
a beautiful job.

425
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,010
Create good glass and
transfer good glass.

426
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,056
The senator mentioned the
workers union in his speech.

427
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,191
Does Fuyao have any
good strategies

428
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,395
for avoiding these risks?

429
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,032
Hey, Charles. How you doing, man?

430
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,004
Dave, there's one thing I
got to talk to you about.

431
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,447
Regarding Sherrod
Brown's comments...

432
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,198
Yes.

433
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,951
You know, that's obviously
not beneficial to us.

434
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,035
Absolutely right.

435
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,405
Don't wanna talk about
certain topics.

436
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:55,406
Correct.

437
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:57,290
So I think, at this point,
Chairman, you know,

438
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,167
will definitely ask about

439
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,450
- what we're gonna do about it.
- It's okay. Yeah. Yeah.

440
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,506
I'm gonna have to kill a senator.

441
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,963
I'm gonna take those
big scissors and

442
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:11,095
cut the... Senator Brown's head.

443
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,222
He...

444
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:15,287
It's big.

445
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,976
He didn't tell us he
was gonna do that.

446
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,395
He did that on purpose,
so they're cut off.

447
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,314
They'll never be allowed
in the plant again.

448
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,488
You all know our stand on this.

449
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,992
We don't want to see the
union developing here.

450
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,662
"First, you all know
our stand on this,

451
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,622
that we want to avoid unions."

452
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,501
If we have a union, it will
impact our efficiency,

453
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,127
thus hurting our company.

454
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,714
It will create loss for us.

455
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:52,428
If a union comes in,
I'm shutting down.

456
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:58,685
They keep interfering
with my production.

457
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,854
Slowly bleeding money is
even worse than a union.

458
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,058
"Right now,

459
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,441
if they're creating extreme
inefficiency in my production,

460
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,610
I'm just bleeding money."

461
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,072
John, if you want to
continue to be president,

462
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,533
you have to listen to my advice.

463
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
Every piece of glass counts.

464
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,992
Every piece that goes
down that line and

465
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:26,713
goes... gets on that
customer truck,

466
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,796
it matters.

467
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,049
Our customers are counting on us.

468
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,469
General Motors, Chrysler,
Toyota, Honda.

469
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,612
Whether it's coming from China or
whether it's coming from Dayton,

470
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,433
it's the same...
it's the same thing.

471
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,102
We have to be able to
provide them glass

472
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,521
at the same level of efficiency,

473
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,774
the same level of
cost and quality.

474
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,068
It's audit day.

475
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,446
We don't have glass to show them.

476
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,656
We should have some ready

477
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,366
for the customers to check.

478
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,370
The glass is gonna run
through the furnace,

479
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,746
basically the same as the
other furnace over here.

480
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,748
This one's just a
little bit faster.

481
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
So it comes down the
line, it comes in here.

482
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
Down in here is another
one of those free-liners

483
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,087
that puts the glass into position.

484
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,714
This is an automatic...

485
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,443
Keep it or throw it out?

486
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,278
- Throw out.
- Throw it...? Okay.

487
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,158
There must be some flaws
if the glass exploded.

488
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,080
The overall quality of the
glass is not good enough,

489
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,727
but there's no way
to improve it now.

490
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,291
We still want to
achieve our targets.

491
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,376
One is output. The
second is speed.

492
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,128
We need one more person.

493
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,923
Transfer someone from China here.

494
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,884
You have the Chinese, who
want numbers on this side.

495
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,344
You have Quality, who wants

496
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,972
customer satisfaction
on this side.

497
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,516
And we're in the middle.

498
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,145
Today was a shitshow,
totally a shitshow.

499
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,774
Any little microscopic
chip can cause a breakage.

500
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,693
As soon as it hits the
press, it begins to cool.

501
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,654
If there's a...

502
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,282
Got it?

503
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,694
Four hundred-and-something
degrees.

504
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,517
And they're six feet away from it?

505
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,602
We need to find some solutions,

506
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,605
whether it's them stepping
into a colder room

507
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,399
as soon as they leave there...

508
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,277
We've got to get them some relief.

509
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,748
How much time do you
spend in there?

510
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,000
About ten minutes or so.

511
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,460
Ten minutes an hour, a day, a...?

512
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
Sometimes every hour.

513
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,841
So every hour? So you go in
there, it's about 200 degrees,

514
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,495
and you clean up in there for
about two hours... All right.

515
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,773
The conditions...

516
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,526
are not favourable.

517
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,448
Doing the same thing
over and over again.

518
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,701
That wears on you.

519
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,624
Body, mind...

520
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,046
You're so... It's...

521
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,797
Sometimes you think...

522
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,676
"Why am I doing this?"

523
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,477
You think about whether
you have the stamina

524
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,439
and the will to do
this type of job.

525
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,049
Anything they're not happy about?

526
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,592
It gets really hot in here.

527
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,035
Our American colleagues
are very afraid of heat.

528
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,747
We try to give them the
environment they want,

529
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,750
as long as it's within
a reasonable budget.

530
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,589
The spaces between the production
lines are pretty narrow.

531
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,510
The Occupational Safety
& Health Administration

532
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,928
thinks it's too dense.

533
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,056
"A tall tree catches the wind."

534
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,975
Yes, it's a huge tree.

535
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,817
Let's welcome Chairman.

536
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,324
Dear staff,

537
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,075
good morning.

538
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,664
We haven't reached our goals.

539
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,918
This is a very tough
challenge for us.

540
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,715
We are all Chinese.

541
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,385
We were born

542
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,557
of Chinese mothers.

543
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,422
No matter where you die or are

544
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:38,232
buried, you will
always be Chinese.

545
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,861
The motherland is like a mother.

546
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,321
This is eternal.

547
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,325
Today, Chinese come to the
US to operate factories.

548
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,497
The most important thing is
not how much money we earn,

549
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,960
but how this will change
Americans' views of the Chinese

550
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,087
and towards China.

551
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,825
Every Chinese person
should do things

552
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:08,304
for our country and our people.

553
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,060
It's down to every
one of you here.

554
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,531
American workers are not
efficient, and output is low.

555
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,950
I can't manage them.

556
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,975
When we try to manage them, they

557
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:36,832
threaten to get help
from the union.

558
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,979
How can we make
Americans understand

559
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,316
that the Chinese can open
factories in America?

560
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,529
This is a big problem.

561
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,386
- Hey. Welcome. Thank you.
- Welcome. Nice to see you again.

562
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,536
- How are you? Good?
- Good.

563
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,621

Ni hao.

577
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,367
- Ni hao.
- Pleasure.

578
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,620
Ni hao. Good morning.
Pleasure to meet you.

579
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,580
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

580
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,123
- Ni hao.
- Nice to meet you.

581
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,209
- Thank you.
- Good morning.

582
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,543
Nice to meet you.

583
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,629
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

584
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,255
Ni hao.

585
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,547
Good morning, my name
is John Withrow.

586
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:35,052
I'm supervisor in Lamination.

587
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,846
Good morning. I'm Austin Cole.

588
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,724
I'm a tempering backlight
production supervisor.

589
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,271
Jon Helton, the continuous
improvement supervisor.

590
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,625
Good morning, Darren Noble. Lead

591
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:50,526
supervisor, ARG
packaging assembly.

592
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,280
Welcome, everybody.

593
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,282
Welcome home.

594
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,832
The whole world is looking at FGA
and you guys are the top guns.

595
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,089
We are investing in the US.

596
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,509
We love the country, and we
want to be part of the country

597
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,178
and provide benefits
to the country.

598
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,599
And we hope that FGA
will be profitable soon

599
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:26,854
and to let our customers know
that we are a strong company.

600
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,233
This is a very valuable time
and also a special time.

601
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,445
Tonight we'll have you join
our year-end group party,

602
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:39,867
and, we also hope you can, get
some time to taste local cuisines.

603
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,828
Thank you for putting
us up in a nice hotel.

604
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,245
Yes.

605
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,584
I think that we are also anxious
to see how your process runs

606
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,170
and look forward to
taking back new ideas

607
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,797
and implementations to help
us run better as well.

608
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,697
I can't breathe in that.

609
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,452
Non-stop.

610
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

611
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,312
This is the line
they'll run 7,000 on?

612
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,692
We hope someday to get this good.

613
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,205
Attention.

614
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,249
Dress right.

615
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,755
Keep an eye on the distance

616
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,048
between yourself and others.

617
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,175
Eyes front.

618
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,968
Straddle.

619
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,472
Hello, everyone.

620
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,557
Good. We are good.

621
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:09,558
Number off.

622
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,059
- One.
- Two.

623
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
- Three.
- Four.

624
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,061
- Five.
- Six.

625
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,062
- Seven.
- Eight.

626
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,063
- Nine.
- Ten.

627
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,064
Eleven.

628
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,065
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

629
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,066
- Fourteen.
- Fifteen.

630
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,067
- Sixteen.
- Seventeen.

631
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,068
Eighteen.

632
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,069
Nineteen. Report.

633
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,590
There should be 19 people in this
team, and all 19 people are here.

634
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Over.

635
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
Good afternoon.

636
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,660
Good afternoon.

637
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,413
- Sorry.
- Sorry. Sorry.

638
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,124
- Please.
- Please. Please.

639
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

640
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,835
Attention.

641
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,798
- Our team name is?
- Improvement.

642
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,256
Our slogan is?

643
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,927
To stand still is to move back.

644
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,344
Attention.

645
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,268
The preparation meeting is over.

646
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,439
Dismissed.

647
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,090
I heard things are not
going too well over there.

648
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,163
Right. That's true. That's why
we're doing training here.

649
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,710
You guys have eight
days off every month.

650
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,128
You have all the weekends.

651
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,297
Only eight hours a day.
That's an easy life.

652
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,381
Yes.

653
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,677
These workers only have one
or two days off per month.

654
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,428
They're not too happy about that.

655
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:34,434
That's why I told you American
workers are too lazy.

656
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,062
It's just your nature.
But you're not bad.

657
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,073
Every person can be changed.

658
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:41,900
We have some extremely
diligent workers.

659
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,070
Very motivated, very ambitious.

660
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,153
They're great.

661
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,242
But most workers are there
just to make money,

662
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,660
not to make glass.

663
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,412
How many hours a day do they work?

664
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,788
Eight hours per shift.

665
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,583
Eight hours. So about
100 dollars a day.

666
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,545
Here we say you have to
be worthy of your salary.

667
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,298
You need to prove you deserve
it. You understand, right?

668
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,591
Yes, I understand.

669
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,263
I heard that your workers like
to joke around and talk a lot.

670
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,683
The best tool we can
use is duct tape.

671
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,978
Put it over their mouths.
They will perform better.

672
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,733
- Tape?
- Tape on their mouths.

673
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,817
Can you do that there?

674
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,884
No, we can't. But if we could do

675
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:28,238
that, we'd have
improved production.

676
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,241
Because they're too chatty now.

677
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,161
Well, the most important thing

678
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,915
is that you all should be united
and concentrate your efforts.

679
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,719
It's not bad working here.

680
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,387
I'm married.

681
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,056
My child is in my home town.

682
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,419
We don't have many holidays, so I

683
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,226
don't have much time
to go back home.

684
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,188
Only during the Spring
Festival, once a year.

685
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,775
We work 12 hours a shift.

686
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,406
I'm tired, but I have no choice.

687
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,394
We work whenever we're
asked by our leader.

688
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,997
I have two kids now.

689
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,833
One is six months old, the
other is four years old.

690
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,918
They're pretty young.

691
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,172
If we're too busy, we may not
be able to take days off.

692
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,467
I only go home once
or twice a year.

693
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,139
My older kid is 11, and
the younger one is eight.

694
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:43,355
I work long hours and I spend
very little time with them.

695
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,904
Holy shit.

696
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,409
They don't have any safety glasses
on, nothing. Unbelievable.

697
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,202
Those aren't even
cut-resistant gloves.

698
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,454
Man, that is nuts.

699
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,456
You got to be kidding me.

700
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:08,005
The glass in our factory...

701
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,009
Different glass colours have
different values for recycling.

702
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,412
So they have to sort the colours.

703
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,282
These people sit there
all day long doing that.

704
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,476
That's fucking crazy. Picking
through fucking glass like that.

705
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,014
We are energetic at Fuyao.

706
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:04,561
All of us are energetic
and happy to work here.

707
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:09,566
All of our workers are members
of the workers union.

708
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,541
Mao Zedong,

709
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,628
and this is Deng Xiaoping,

710
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,338
Jiang Zemin,

711
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,506
Hu Jintao,

712
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,839
Xi Jinping.

713
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,971
These are the five leaders
since China was established.

714
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,500
Without backing from
the government,

715
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,937
the company wouldn't get too far.

716
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,315
Our workers union and the company

717
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,068
are closely related to each other.

718
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:57,280
They are like two gears
rotating together.

719
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,826
We need our workers to
fight for Fuyao's success.

720
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,162
We are all in the same boat.

721
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,790
Keeping the boat safe
means everyone is safe.

722
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:11,294
If the boat sinks,
everyone loses their jobs.

723
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,797
It's quite simple.

724
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,267
Chairman Cao, here
is a hada for you.

725
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,773
Next on the red carpet will
be workers from two teams.

726
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:36,027
They have won the
Excellent Team award.

727
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,230
Year 2017...

728
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,283
"Soaring ambitions."

729
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,245
"The spirit of craftsmanship
is all over China."

730
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:06,600
Let's welcome Chairman Cao
with our warmest applause.

731
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,825
Dear Chairman,

732
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,037

773

From this moment on,

774
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,834
no matter poor or rich,

775
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,254
you will always care for her,

776

cherish her, and protect her,

777
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,715
until forever.

778
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,842
Will you?

779
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,605
- Yes, I will.
- Yes, I will.

780
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,330
We're one...

781
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,083
big planet.

782
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,299
A world...

783
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,261
somewhat divided.

784
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,601
But we're one.

785
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,941
And tonight is an example.

786
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,571
- Happy. Happy.
- Aww.

787
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,739
Happy tears.

788
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,325
I'm very happy to share
in your culture.

789
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,660
- Thanks so much.
- No, thank you.

790
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,120
We are one.

791
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,122
- Yes, we are one.
- We are one.

792
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,875
Yes. One tongue, one company.

793
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,959
Yes.

794
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,627
Thank you.

795
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,297
- Aren't watermelons sweet?
- Sweet.

796
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:35,011
Choose the best picture
to put on the cover

797
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,094
of the next edition
of Fuyao People.

798
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,607
This is my community,

799
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,610
and to see this building
come back to life,

800
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,902
it meant a lot to me.

801
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,615
Fuyao is the leader, Fuyao
is changing the industry,

802
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,202
and I see us becoming number
one in the world next year

803
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,704
and number one in the
world every year.

804
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,173
Yes, sir. How are you doing?

805
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,768
I have a really good idea for you.

806
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,792
Why don't you film

807
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,712
those three microwave ovens that
have been out for two weeks

808
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,881
- that haven't been replaced?
- Okay.

809
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,175
- Why don't you film that?
- We will.

810
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:18,137
And tell me why this area is now
gonna be used for production

811
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,515
and no longer a lunchroom.

812
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,296
There's signs all
over that say that.

813
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:23,726
Where's the lunchroom gonna be?

814
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,208
I have no clue.
You're telling me...

815
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:26,209
That's typical.

816
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,915
You're telling me...
telling me something new.

817
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,566
I just got back from vacation.

818
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,835
They're gonna take all the
tables and all the chairs out

819
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,779
and make this a production
space. Like everywhere else.

820
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,532
I hope they make your
office a production space.

821
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,413
They manage to have these things
on all the time. This is America.

822
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,874
We don't need Chinese
children singing and praying.

823
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,546
Coming back from the China trip,

824
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,509
some of the things I
started implementing...

825
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,800
Well, the first thing
I implemented was...

826
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,468
At our pre-shift meeting,

827
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,221
we used to just kind of sit
at the tables and talk and...

828
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,720
watching the Chinese
shift meeting,

829
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:03,057
where he had them all lined up...

830
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,269
I've found that that's worked out
really well for me back here.

831
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,187
Good morning, everybody.

832
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,150
Greg, I need you to stand
on two, starting off.

833
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,363
Chuck, I need you
standing on three.

834
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,950
I think that's everybody.

835
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,702
It's an experiment.

836
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,872
So, the lines are
running okay today?

837
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,333
Everybody got your
glasses and boots?

838
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,001
We're good?

839
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,420
Any questions?

840
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,216
Okay, let's have a good day.

841
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,972
They're gonna do
surgery for your hand?

842
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:46,118
They're gonna tell me tomorrow.

843
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,478
They'll tell you tomorrow what
your recovery's gonna be.

844
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,355
Yeah, they'll probably
start at four weeks,

845
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,273
determine what... you
know, how it's gonna be,

846
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,651
and then, from there,
go to the eight weeks.

847
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,528
I'm worried about my points.

848
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,238
- No, no...
- No, no, no, no.

849
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,382
Don't worry about any of that.

850
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,206
Don't have to worry about
your points for missing time.

851
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:03,207
I don't wanna lose my job.

852
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,328
No, you're not gonna
lose your job.

853
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,411
- What's that?
- My pay?

854
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,146
- Yes.
- It's covered?

855
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,333
Yes. I don't know how
all of that works,

856
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,416
but it is.

857
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,459
Yeah.

858
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,991
Everybody at every
level will say we

859
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,724
really, really, really
want to be safe.

860
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,977
But safe doesn't pay the bills.

861
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:42,657
The room that we work in,
there's only one way in,

862
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,742
no doors on the opposite side.

863
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,496
If a fire breaks out,

864
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,873
that's like being trapped.

865
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,852
They're wanting us to pull one of

866
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:00,883
those big sheets off
and inspect it.

867
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,637
Some of this float glass is so big

868
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,931
that I'm gonna have people
exposing their face,

869
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,642
and I don't... I don't
need to do that.

870
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,105
A couple days ago, I had
to tell the Chinese fellow

871
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,983
that I absolutely
refuse to pick up

872
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,777
two loads with a
stand-up forklift.

873
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,320
It's not strong enough.

874
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,391
I said, "If you want
to do it, that's

875
01:02:23,392 --> 01:02:24,991
fine, you do it. I'm not doing it.

876
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,952
I'm not... I'm not risking
somebody's life."

877
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,799
Out of all my working life,

878
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,804
I have never ever had a
workplace injury, ever.

879
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,850
I mean, 15 years
at General Motors,

880
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,811
you know, never a
workplace injury.

881
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,274
And then my new job at Fuyao...

882
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,817
what happens?

883
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,236
I get a workplace injury.

884
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,808
Right now, I'm outside
the Moraine plant here,

885
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,334
off Kettering Boulevard.

886
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,879
There have been 11 safety
complaints filed against Fuyao.

887
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,465
Some workers claim unsafe
working conditions

888
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,548
and unfair treatment.

889
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,260
I say "people," you say "power."

890
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,595
- People.
- Power.

891
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,263
- People.
- Power.

892
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,641
I say "people," you say "union."

893
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,184
- People.
- Union.

894
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,685
- People.
- Union.

895
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,996
All right. Whoo.

896
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,439
Meeting after work, don't
forget, next week.

897
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,608
We'll see you there.
Bring your co-workers.

898
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:45,780
There's a lot of information that
you're seeing on TV about Fuyao.

899
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,491
"Safety concerns,"

900
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,453
other things that are...
are being reported,

901
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,373
much of which we do
not believe are true.

902
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,459
Because if you bring in a union...

903
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,255
this becomes illegal.

904
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,215
You cannot do it any more.

905
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,680
Instead, if I'm an employee,

906
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,224
I have to take my concerns
to the union rep.

907
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:18,020
When we had this
training in private,

908
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,857
I was horrified by this picture.

909
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,528
If this becomes a reality,

910
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,865
we wouldn't be able to
communicate directly

911
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,159
with our American co-workers.

912
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,288
Isn't that terrible?

913
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,891
If we are able to improve our
management capabilities,

914
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,269
it will help quell
the union rebellion.

915
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,498
"And if we are able to improve
our management capabilities,

916
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:05,234
it will help with our campaign
against union organisations..."

917
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:10,656
We hired Americans to work as
our managers and supervisors.

918
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:16,746
Our expectation was that
we could trust them,

919
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,875
pay them a high salary, and
they would serve the company.

920
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,258
Why didn't they?

921
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:35,890
I think they are
hostile to Chinese.

922
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:44,190
The loss from January to October

923
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,860
is about 40 million US dollars.

924
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,615
We have to reverse the
tide as soon as possible.

925
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,701
With the new restructuring,

926
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,663
I believe we will see this
plant in profit very soon.

927
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,750
We've invited Jeff Liu
to be our new president.

928
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,300
Good morning, everyone.

929
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:18,015
I was born in 1963, in
the Year of the Rabbit.

930
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,228
I've spent 27 years in the
US and 26 years in China.

931
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,108
People always guess I am in
my 40s, but I'm actually 53.

932
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,819
Why is that? Because
I have passion.

933
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,321
I have determination
to do things well.

934
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,665
"A major shake-up of the company's
senior management team,

935
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,750
with company President
John Gauthier

936
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,004
and Vice President
Dave Burrows leaving."

937
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,547
Actually...

938
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,673
terminated.

944
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,730
Need a hat, Jim?

945
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,524

Thanks for your work.

948
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,158
Hello, everybody.

949
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,869
I would like to use
this opportunity

950
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,414
to thank each of you
for the hard work.

951
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,501
And also, we need
to work as a team

952
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,504
under one roof, one culture,

953
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,216
and make a great year for 2017.

954
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,676
We can turn the company around.

955
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,806
We make more money, and everybody
gonna share the piece of pie.

956
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,015
How's that?

957
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:28,938
Not bad.

958
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,292
You want a hat, Chairman?

959
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,402
He asked if you want a hat.

960
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,781
Of course.

961
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,283
Here you go, boss.

962
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,746
Let me wear a hat.

963
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,166
Hi.

964
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,003
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao, ni hao, ni hao.

965
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,463
- Hello.
- Ni hao.

966
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,340
Ni hao.

967
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,113
Someone from work was
kind enough to tell me

968
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,240
that there were these apartments.

969
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,243
Four hundred and eighty
dollars a month.

970
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,078
I fell in love with it.

971
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,542
I can afford to live here

972
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,130
and have my own place and
feel independent again.

973
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,808
Smells good.

974
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,209
This is the most enjoyable
moment in a day.

975
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:17,838
After I finish the cigarette,
my mind just calms down.

976
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:25,512
We workers lay down tracks

977
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,767
so the train can run smoothly.

978
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:36,482
The only thing we have in
mind is to do our best.

979
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,944
That's true for everyone here.

980
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:42,947
My wife.

981
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:49,245
My toothache has gone.

982
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,332
I've fully recovered.

983
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,557
The last time I cried,
I was a teenager.

984
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,561
But I cried once
after coming here.

985
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,857
I don't dare mention
that to other people.

986
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:26,448
But when all is quiet
in the dead of night,

987
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:32,746
I miss my family.

988
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:52,016
I've learnt most of what I
learnt from Leon and Wong.

989
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,646
None of us knew glass
when we came there.

990
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,844
When you get to be my age, not
too many people wanna hire you.

991
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,536
They don't wanna take a chance.

992
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,876
My brother, he's my
Chinese brother.

993
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,048
I would have his back, just like
I'd have one of my own brothers'.

994
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,592
I just... I think
the world of him.

995
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,099
Are you okay?

996
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,896
My supervisor started
yelling at me.

997
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,857
When... You work at the
table right there.

998
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,442
I was working right
here just fine.

999
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,960
Now he wanna change
it right over here.

1000
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,087
We know, the table over there.

1001
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,739
Now, instead of here, they
want you to do it here? Okay.

1002
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:51,116
He said he expects us to
do eight boxes at a time.

1003
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,219
I just want to make sure
you're not gonna get hurt.

1004
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,804
He said he want us to
push them in here.

1005
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,140
Well, now, you... It's probably
too heavy for you to push it.

1006
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,898
So you need to let him know that.

1007
01:12:58,899 --> 01:12:59,958
I don't understand.

1008
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,420
Sometimes, why she don't
know to tell that?

1009
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:06,131
Make sure you're communicating
to them that you need help.

1010
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,215
I have.

1011
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,217
He knows.

1012
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,906
Rather than trying
to find resolution,

1013
01:13:13,907 --> 01:13:15,557
they try to find out who's wrong.

1014
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,310
And, in this case,
they're both wrong.

1015
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,675
You need some skills
to handle Americans.

1016
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,985
How can we take advantage
of American characteristics

1017
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,571
to make them work for Fuyao?

1018
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,951
There's a culture in the US

1019
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:38,372
where children are showered
with encouragement.

1020
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:44,086
So everyone who grows up in
the US is overconfident.

1021
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,464
They are super confident.

1022
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:52,177
Americans love being
flattered to death.

1023
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,806
You will get into trouble
if you fight with them.

1024
01:13:56,723 --> 01:14:00,269
"Donkeys like being touched in
the direction their hair grows."

1025
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,186
Right?

1026
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,275
You should touch donkeys in the
direction their hair grows.

1027
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,734
Otherwise, they'll kick you.

1028
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,447
Do you understand what I'm
saying? You do? Okay.

1029
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:16,910
We need to use our wisdom to
guide them and help them.

1030
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,495
Because we are better than them.

1031
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,785
They refer to us as
"the foreigners."

1032
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,735
People just want...
They wanna feel

1033
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:30,132
like they're in America working,

1034
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,029
not like, when they
walk in the door,

1035
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,428
that they've left America
and they're now in China.

1036
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,016
They work non-stop. They're
in there all the time.

1037
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:42,186
Around the clock, 24 hours a day.
They're in there on Sundays.

1038
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,914
There's been some days, they don't
want us to take a break for lunch,

1039
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,441
because they need X
amount of glass out.

1040
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,903
The Chinese really don't
help us out at all.

1041
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,530
They just walk around and tell
the Americans what to do.

1042
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,991
"Just do this." And
you're like, "Why?"

1043
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,994
They don't tell you why at
all, and they walk away.

1044
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,081
I know it's a growing
company, I know it's new.

1045
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,167
But with the workload
that comes with it,

1046
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,090
you know, you wanna keep
your employees around,

1047
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,712
especially your good workers.

1048
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,965
A simple pay raise, even
if it's just a dollar.

1049
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,885
Just show your appreciation
for them and their hard work.

1050
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,891
Optimism, hope. That was what
we were all going in with.

1051
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,060
The future looked bright.

1052
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,355
Now, it's just... It's a 180.

1053
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,317
To me, it's like they
don't respect you.

1054
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,535
At least 3,000 people have come
and gone, either fired or quit.

1055
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,916
Whenever you have a frustrating
day, you can go outside and...

1056
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,668
throw your bin over.

1057
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,097
Every one of our
bosses were demoted.

1058
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,724
- Yeah.
- The Chinese are in control.

1059
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,894
Have the Chinese
changed their mind?

1060
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,689
Are they not gonna
turn this over to us?

1061
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,994
Because that was one of the...

1062
01:16:10,995 --> 01:16:12,418
definitely that was
one of the things

1063
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,278
that intrigued me
about coming here.

1064
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,573
I love the fact that they came
in here. I love this business.

1065
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,158
I worked at Appleton
for over 20 years

1066
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,161
and I was one of the guys
that got laid off in 2012.

1067
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,081
I've been looking for
something for four years.

1068
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,793
I like working with the
people on the floor.

1069
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,837
They are working their tails off.

1070
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,591
And they're not getting
anything for it,

1071
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,135
and I'm not talking
about compensation.

1072
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:40,304
They're not getting
patted on the back.

1073
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,791
I've seen the Chinese pouring
chemicals down the drain

1074
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,351
out the back of our dock.

1075
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,435
Chemicals.

1076
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,373
There was a trail of yellow
paint going right to the sewer.

1077
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,208
- Right out our back door.
- You couldn't miss it.

1078
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,735
It's like they don't even
know what the rules are.

1079
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,068
It's...

1080
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:59,406
And I'm thinking, "This is
all going into the sewer

1081
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,075
and going into drinking
water somewhere."

1082
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,955
I don't wanna waste your time and
I don't wanna to waste my time.

1083
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,624
With what we say at this table,

1084
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,375
will it make a difference?

1085
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,581
I've asked security to come escort

1086
01:17:40,582 --> 01:17:42,407
you out if you're
going to do that.

1087
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,491
Okay.

1088
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,896
Man, they treat these
people like shit in there.

1089
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,529
Sometimes, you got
to be Sally Field.

1090
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,956
If there are things
your boss can't

1091
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:29,454
fix for you, come talk to me.

1092
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,290
Especially how to manage
American workers.

1093
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,628
Can we force them
to work overtime?

1094
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,755
- Americans?
- Americans.

1095
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:40,924
From HR's perspective,

1096
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,594
we can't force them
to work overtime.

1097
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,180
We can't say anything like that.

1098
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,976
But in China, it's mandatory.

1099
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,062
The Americans... I don't
give a shit what they think.

1100
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,897
Go ahead and sue me,

1101
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,066
but they should come the
hell in on Saturdays.

1102
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,026
That's how I would do it.

1103
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:27,554
I think the most important
thing is mutual understanding.

1104
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:34,728
We're under enormous
pressure here.

1105
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,398
A lot more pressure than in China.

1106
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:44,529
There was a guy who couldn't fall
asleep for a couple of days.

1107
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:49,868
I really admire Americans.

1108
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,369
They can work two jobs.

1109
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,331
They can have another job
besides working here.

1110
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,044
I always thought Americans lived
a comfortable and superior life.

1111
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:04,549
I thought they didn't have
to make any sacrifices.

1112
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,405
Good afternoon, everyone.

1113
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,449
Good afternoon.

1114
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:33,203
All the stories that you've
heard about Fuyao is true.

1115
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:35,789
Just to give you an
idea how things are,

1116
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,542
my daughter does
nails for a living.

1117
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,087
Last year, she made
$13,000 more than I did.

1118
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,006
Now, think about that.

1119
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,510
She cleared $40,000. I made 27.

1120
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,804
Something's wrong with that.

1121
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,141
A co-worker of mine was fired

1122
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,145
for being hospitalised for a
week and not calling off.

1123
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,274
That could've been me.
What if I got sick?

1124
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,025
Would they fire me?

1125
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,111
The man I was working with,

1126
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,822
the cardboard he was
sitting on caught on fire.

1127
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,032
And they just kept
right on working.

1128
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:15,036
Dayton taxpayers and the
state of Ohio have committed

1129
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,832
tens of millions of
dollars to Fuyao,

1130
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,626
and yet Fuyao
management has failed

1131
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,004
to provide the good
and the safe jobs

1132
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,339
that this community deserves.

1133
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:29,885
Labour.

1134
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,930
Working people and the labour
movement built America.

1135
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,310
It is what made America
great the first time.

1136
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,480
The working people at Fuyao
right now who don't have a...

1137
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,608
You have a birthright
that's paid for

1138
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:47,360
by the sweat and blood
of people in this room

1139
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,613
and people who have gone
before people in this room,

1140
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,574
so that you had a
right to fair life,

1141
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,618
to a workplace that was safe.

1142
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,954
We fought these
battles 70 years ago.

1143
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,248
We rejected 70 years ago

1144
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,293
that management and
companies and rich people

1145
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,295
get to pick and choose

1146
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,298
what happens to you or what you
get or what you don't get.

1147
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,552
Nothing in America has changed

1148
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,013
in terms of working
people working hard.

1149
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,806
That's not what
changed in America.

1150
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,643
What changed in America
was people at the top

1151
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,312
deciding they wanted
to rewrite the rules

1152
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,105
to take advantage of people.

1153
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,235
To make it in their
favour at your expense.

1154
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,697
And you have a right and an
obligation to say no to that,

1155
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,951
and that's what unionising
at Fuyao is all about.

1156
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,246
And over the course of fighting
for this all these years,

1157
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,326
we found a way for
companies to make

1158
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:44,376
money and still be
fair to employees,

1159
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,628
and still pay employees
a decent wage,

1160
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,713
and still make sure
that they were safe.

1161
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,715
These two things can
exist together.

1162
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,551
As you fight this fight at Fuyao,

1163
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,805
as UAW stands by you and
fights that fight with you,

1164
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,465
as we show Fuyao
that we do things a

1165
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:01,726
little bit different
in Dayton, Ohio,

1166
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,313
I will be there every step of
the way fighting with you,

1167
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,983
on the side of UAW, on
the side of workers,

1168
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,694
and we will win this
fight. Thank you.

1169
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,910
- Morning.
- Morning.

1170
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,913
Next Monday...

1171
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,083
everybody already
employed in this room,

1172
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,502
whatever you're paid
today, two dollars more.

1173
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:31,840
Thank you.

1174
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,978
Everybody, whatever
you make today,

1175
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:43,101
two dollars more next Monday.

1176
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,352
Yeah.

1177
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,563
Great?

1178
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,749
And the people say, "Why are you
doing that? We're losing money."

1179
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:57,907
The good efficiency generate
from the good employee.

1180
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,745
How do we keep a good
employee? Better pay.

1181
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:08,251
We want to be the best employer
in this town. But in return...

1182
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,880
work hard, work longer.

1183
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,216
Our team here, we can do
the same job as China.

1184
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:22,390
Raise the bar, and I believe the
future will belong to everybody.

1185
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,016
Thanks again.

1186
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:06,643
Victory. Whoo.

1187
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:12,690
- We are the union.
- We are the union.

1188
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,485
- UAW.
- UAW.

1189
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:18,822
They don't want to have to abide
by the rules and regulations

1190
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,323
of the United States.

1191
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:23,284
They're in America, and
we want to make sure

1192
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,246
that they abide by
the laws in America.

We have a better chance of
having things done fair

1201
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,089
if we have it written
out in a contract.

1202
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,758
That's why we need a union.

1203
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,846
Management would listen to
us because they had to.

1204
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,852
Every job I've ever worked
on, being a black woman,

1205
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:36,941
that's the only way
that we have a chance.

1206
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,078
I understand that,
at times, there's

1207
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:40,361
gonna be a need for a union,

1208
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,573
but right now, I got a man
that's given me a good job,

1209
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,951
given me a good wage, and allowed
me to come to work every day.

1210
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,846
I don't have any need
for somebody else

1211
01:26:48,847 --> 01:26:50,747
to come in and get in
the middle of this.

1212
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:56,044
The only thing the union's gonna
do is keep the bad workers.

1213
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:59,505
And the good workers, it's just
gonna go along like it is for us.

1214
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,634
How's that work for me?

1215
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:19,817
I know there are some
union activists here.

1216
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:24,530
I know because I have people

1217
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,491
who spy for me.

1218
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:30,870
I have many different
ways to deal with them.

1219
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,206
Here is one. He is pro-union.

1220
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:39,462
This is him. This person here.

1221
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,550
Look, we get along pretty well.

1222
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,929
You won't see him here
in two weeks' time.

1223
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,484
Good afternoon.

1224
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,403
I want to thank you
so much for coming.

1225
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:05,321
I know you didn't have a choice.

1226
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,329
The union will go out of their way

1227
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,493
to try to convince you that
it's a good thing for you

1228
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,375
and that it is in
your best interest.

1229
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:19,877
The contract that you get,

1230
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,296
if you get one,

1231
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,923
might include better
wages and benefits.

1232
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,893
That contract might
include the same

1233
01:28:25,894 --> 01:28:27,677
wages and benefits you have today.

1234
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:30,690
And that contract finally might

1235
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:33,641
include less wages
and less benefits.

1236
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:38,604
And the threat of a strike is
no longer scary to employers,

1237
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:42,650
because today if you go on strike,
while you can't get fired,

1238
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,820
the employer has the right
to permanently replace you.

1239
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:48,489
I'll let that sink in.

1240
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,114
You can't get fired
for going on strike,

1241
01:28:52,115 --> 01:28:54,120
but you can get
permanently replaced.

1242
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,415
So are you telling us not
to vote for the union?

1243
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,418
I'm here to tell you
to do what you want.

1244
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,545
I got a question. Who
do you work for?

1245
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,065
I work for a company called
Labour Relations Institute.

1246
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,507
We're a labour consulting firm.

1247
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,676
- Is the company paying you?
- Yes.

1248
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,738
Didn't I say that? I usually
say that in every meeting.

1249
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,406
- No.
- No, you didn't say that yet.

1250
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,600
Well, the reality is, they pay
me to consult with you here...

1251
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,310
They pay you to talk to us?

1252
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:18,943
They pay me. They
don't pay me enough

1253
01:29:18,944 --> 01:29:20,289
to stand up here and lie to you.

1254
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,148
Okay?

1255
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:30,615
He says that he was being
impartial, but he wasn't.

1256
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,621
The UAW is free to use
everywhere else in the world.

1257
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,415
If they want to pay our...
pay our workforce

1258
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:42,335
to sit through a presentation,
to listen to the pitch,

1259
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,003
that's their right.

1260
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,465
But while they're on our
clock, it's our message.

1261
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,261
They spent a lot of money to
bring these people in here

1262
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,847
to make sure that every employee

1263
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,100
goes through this session,

1264
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,852
not once, but twice,
maybe three times.

1265
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:05,149
They have people walking around
there with patches and stickers on

1266
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,860
that's saying: "Vote no.

1267
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,779
You still have a voice."

1268
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:11,864
Now, my question to
them people are:

1269
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,242
What voice do you have?

1270
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,619
When have you ever had a voice?

1271
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,855
Ever since they started this
job, it's been a two-man job.

1272
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,816
When they put me out here on it,

1273
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:49,819
they decided they wanted
it to be a one-person job.

1274
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,866
When I went to talk to HR, I told
them they were targeting me.

1275
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:00,413
Put me on a job to set me up to
write me up for performance issues

1276
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:01,789
and fire me.

1277
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,902
I got the phone call from Fuyao

1278
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,820
that they had fired me.

1279
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,365
I really truly feel like...
that they targeted me.

1280
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:42,371
I was on the news, I was at
the city council meetings.

1281
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,753
It's been a pretty sad...

1282
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:51,296
few days.

1283
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,800
This sinking feeling of...

1284
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,886
"I don't have a job."

1285
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,640
I mean, I'm a good worker.

1286
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,809
Workers union.

1287
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,189
Should I have gotten so involved?

1288
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,150
Put my whole life into it?

1289
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,117
Here's old Fuyao.

1290
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,621
Can't spell Fuyao without F-U.

1291
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,379
When I was at Fuyao, I didn't
think we needed a union.

1292
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:35,591
Move forward to today, you
have no voice, you have...

1293
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:38,844
Truly, you...

1294
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:43,808
From what I'm told, there really
isn't an American with authority

1295
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,394
that they can talk to.

1296
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:48,728
You know, I...

1297
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,399
I think these employees
need something.

1298
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,447
I think I need to make only
two more trips this year,

1299
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:01,701
if you achieve what you planned.

1300
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,454
Why do I need to come here? It's
not convenient for me. Right?

1301
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,541
You think I like to come
to America every month?

1302
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,668
It's tiring.

1303
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:14,797
Is the union making any noise?

1304
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,674
No, not too much.

1305
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,217
Better than it was before.

1306
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:22,763
Recently, we fired a lot
of union supporters.

1307
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:28,144
We have tried different
ways. It's worked out.

1308
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,080
A lot of active ones left...

1309
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,648
Then you guys should hire
more excellent people.

1310
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:33,774
Young people.

1311
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:37,415
This is the culture I
want for our company.

1312
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:40,197
Then we will have a
good atmosphere here.

1313
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:46,370
A lot of things here in the
US are different from China.

1314
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:50,249
Well, we've invested here already.
It's just not working that well.

1315
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,295
Ah?

1316
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,220
Morning, you all.

1317
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,640
- Fired up, ready to vote.
- Ready to win.

1318
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:07,099
- Ready to vote.
- Ready to win.

1319
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,934
- Ready to win.
- There you go.

1320
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,812
- You ready to win.
- All right, girl.

1321
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,689
Fired up, ready to win.

1322
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:17,693
These are actually people from
the United Auto Workers Union,

1323
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,701
and they're out
here demonstrating,

1324
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:21,572
trying to encourage
Fuyao employees

1325
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:22,782
to vote "yes."

1326
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,325
Fuyao released a statement earlier

1327
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:27,745
saying that they believe the
United Workers Union is corrupted

1328
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,872
and they hope that the
workers vote "no."

1329
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:33,668
More than 1,500 workers
are expected...

1330
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,630
We all have a
psychological shadow.

1331
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:48,057
Fuyao doesn't want to be
controlled by the union.

1332
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,603
As the Chinese saying goes,

1333
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:55,606
"One mountain cannot
hold two tigers."

1334
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,366
Voting just ended an hour ago.

1335
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:07,927
Now the National
Labour Relations Board

1336
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:09,912
is counting those votes
inside the plant

1337
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:13,124
with both Fuyao and
UAW watching...

1338
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,381
Yes.

1339
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,968
We won by a landslide.

1340
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:27,221
We won 60%?

1341
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,680
Right.

1342
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,266
We're awesome.

1343
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,520
868 noes, 444 yes.

1344
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,648
Yeah.

1345
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:39,399
Yeah.

1346
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,610
I wasn't shocked...

1347
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,614
because I know the... the
young people got scared.

1348
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:50,619
Them LRI people scared the
shit out of them, that's all.

1349
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,499
Before we started
having those trainings,

1350
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:56,834
I felt like there was
a big "yes" vote.

1351
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,419
They spoke a lot about a strike,

1352
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:01,130
and like, not being able to be
paid, unless we... You know.

1353
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:05,009
So, I feel like people, you know,
are worried about their income.

1354
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,428
Because I definitely
was, you know? So...

1355
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:10,765
There you have it.
Overwhelming no.

1356
01:36:30,242 --> 01:36:31,442
Good morning, everyone.

1357
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,870
Morning.

1358
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:34,955
Last night I couldn't sleep

1359
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,790
because I feel...

1360
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,711
even more heavier
burden on my shoulder.

1361
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,714
You guys gave me a chance

1362
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,467
to make FGA better.

1363
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:52,056
My goal is gonna work with
the team to make sure

1364
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:56,769
every single issue I
cannot resolve overnight,

1365
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,312
but give me some time.

1366
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:00,773
Can we do this?

1367
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,983
Yeah?

1368
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:06,153
All right, one more
thing: life is short.

1369
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:12,034
We're gonna select the best
ten employees go to China.

1370
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:14,370
There's some pictures.

1371
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:15,996
This is Shanghai.

1372
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:20,042
Shanghai is the most
modern city in China.

1373
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,837
Look like Manhattan, right?

1374
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,714
It's like a Manhattan too.

1375
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,718
Yeah, this is a Hyatt
Hotel. Hyatt Hotel.

1376
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:33,931
They have a sky pool, 55 floor.

1377
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,976
You swim in the sky.

1378
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:39,854
And I'm gonna share the
good news for you.

1379
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,730
One of you lucky guys,

1380
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,732
you're gonna see that city.

1381
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,611
We're one Fuyao, one family.

1382
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,738
We create the miracle.

1383
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:53,075
We need to create success forever.

1384
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,412
Let's make American great again.

1385
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:05,689
The smooth operation
of our US project

1386
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,632
has laid a solid foundation
for our global strategy.

1387
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,471
We've achieved double-digit
growth in operation management.

1388
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,266
Both our earnings and profits
have reached new digits.

1389
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,777
The China of my youth was poor

1390
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,615
and undeveloped.

1391
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:37,786
I feel I was happier then.

1392
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:42,291
Now I live in a new era

1393
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:47,546
of prosperity and modernity,

1394
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:53,344
but I have a sense of loss.

1395
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:06,273
I miss the croaking frogs and
chirping bugs of my childhood.

1396
01:39:06,398 --> 01:39:10,653
The wild flowers
blooming in the field.

1397
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:17,701
In the past few decades, I
have built so many factories.

1398
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:24,750
Have I taken the peace away and
destroyed the environment?

1399
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:33,008
I don't know if I am a
contributor or a sinner.

1400
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,182
But...

1401
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:45,896
I only think that way
when I'm unhappy.

1402
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:56,240
The point of living is to work.

1403
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:01,912
Don't you think so?

1404
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:11,171
Last Friday, I was
terminated from Fuyao

1405
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:12,923
after two and a half years.

1406
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:17,256
The excuse given
was I was too slow

1407
01:40:17,257 --> 01:40:19,805
pulling up something
on the computer.

1408
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,808
Took me about two
or three minutes.

1409
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,268
It wasn't quick enough.

1410
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,273
I wouldn't take away the
last two and a half years.

1411
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:32,484
I met a lot of good friends

1412
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,528
and I learnt a lot
from the Chinese.

1413
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,876
I don't have any food for you.

1414
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,545
I have some watermelon
in my apartment.

1415
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,175
I don't think he can eat fruit.

1416
01:40:56,258 --> 01:40:57,926
He can eat grass.

1417
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:02,323
- Take care, guys.
- See you later.

1418
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:03,891
- Bye, Wong.
- Bye-bye.

1419
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:12,024
In the old days, all Chinese
people wanted in life

1420
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:14,943
was to have enough food
and to raise their kids.

1421
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:17,654
That's all they wanted.

1422
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:26,413
When it comes to my
generation, we want it all.

1423
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:33,837
We travel wherever we want
and buy whatever we like.

1424
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:43,180
GM afforded me a great life...

1425
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:44,890
that was cut off

1426
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:47,226
when they closed the doors.

1427
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:55,651
We will never ever make
that type of money again.

1428
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:57,986
Those days are over.

1429
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:20,551
There you go.

1430
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:25,472
All right.

1431
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,808
- Hey.
- Yay.

1432
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,394
Well, I didn't even know.

1433
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,273
You never give up on
the American dream.

1434
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:36,900
To me, that would be un-American.

1435
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,696
I can have that white fence.

1436
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:42,948
I can have that nice home.

1437
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,119
Send my children to college if
that's what they want to do.

1438
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:53,500
Get treated with common decency.

1439
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,255
You have to be able
to believe in it.

1440
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,483
We used to have one person here.

1441
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:20,360
Now we don't have anyone.

1442
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:23,906
Next, I'm going to get rid
of four workers here.

1443
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:26,074
Two for each line.

1444
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:31,038
Automation means standardisation.

1445
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:32,623
After we finish this,

1446
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,215
we will have two fewer workers

1447
01:43:34,216 --> 01:43:36,126
uploading on the
encapsulation line.

1448
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,170
The mechanical arms
do that instead.

1449
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,464
You have already finished that?

1450
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:41,840
Yes. These are all automatic.

1451
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:43,943
And you're replacing the rest
with mechanical arms too?

1452
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:46,595
Yes. I will replace the ones
on side-window tempering.

1453
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,556
This one is being tested now.

1454
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,309
We're hoping to cancel four
workers in July or August.

1455
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:54,978
I'll change that
into machine work.

1456
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:57,522
We can't get the work done
now. They are too slow.

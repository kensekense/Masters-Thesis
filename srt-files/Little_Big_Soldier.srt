<i>During the Warring States Period,</i>

00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:17,869
<i>China was made up of
dozens of nations.</i>

4
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,027
<i>Countless fights between states.</i>

5
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:23,097
<i>Society was in devastation.</i>

6
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:33,052
<i>The 7 largest states were known as
Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei and Qin.</i>

7
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,894
<i>The rest was nearly wiped out</i>

8
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,257
<i>a hundred years before the unification.</i>

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:47,751
<i>Qin then conquered Han and Zhao
subsequently.</i>

10
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,517
<i>Year 227 B.C.</i>

11
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,582
<i>When Wei's troops marching towards
the state of Liang.</i>

00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:09,781
<i>they were ambushed by Liang
at Mt. Phoenix.</i>

13
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,727
<i>Both sides suffered severely.</i>

14
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,789
<i>Death toll reached 3,000.</i>

15
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,585
Third bro.

16
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,684
Third bro.

17
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,086
You're not lucky as I am.

18
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,349
- General!
- Who are you?

19
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,343
Liang's soldier.

20
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:31,636
<i>One main road
leads to homecoming</i>

21
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:38,982
<i>My home is right at
the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

22
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:46,918
<i>Soils are rich there
5 acres of farms</i>

23
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,769
Pretty good.

24
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:55,033
<i>5 acres of farm
What to grow?</i>

25
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:03,538
Let me tell you something.

26
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,312
When I was a boy, I caught a boar.
My dad had me let go of it.

27
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,113
You know why?

28
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:10,253
There were boys
inside that belly.

29
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:12,249
You have boys?

30
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:19,926
You know what, you're my captive now. Hey, hey.

31
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,947
You've lost few blood.

32
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,537
Not a big deal.

33
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,667
This is the drug developed
by my family.

34
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,621
Don't spare this to anyone.

35
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,963
You hurt?

36
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,074
Now it gonna hurt more.

37
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,837
You're welcome, young man!

38
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,851
You'll live, you know.

39
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,008
And don't curse.

40
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:01,498
My dad said,

41
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:05,206
Scratch when you're itchy,
Smile when you ain't lucky!

42
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,986
Pretty good.

43
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,842
General.

44
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,012
Deputy General Yu.

45
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,376
Yes, I am.

46
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,081
Hang on a sec.

47
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,677
Why you're here?

48
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,351
In pursuit of Liang's men.

49
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,567
In pursuit?
How many have you killed?

50
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,818
Speak.

51
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:08,132
One.

52
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,260
My men must fight hard.

53
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,071
Liang's came hard on us...

54
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,641
Defend our nation with our lives.

55
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,346
Please, for the sake of...

56
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,681
AWOL personnel must face penalty.

57
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,947
General, my company was
all gone last night.

58
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:24,854
Gone? I was there last night.

59
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,238
In fact, we were ambushed.

60
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,717
And you were the traitor.

61
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,794
You're so cruel.

62
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,383
He saved your life, and you took his.

63
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,773
what you gonna do?

64
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:53,913
He was right.

65
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
You're all dead.

66
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:57,914
Kill me.

67
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,105
I don't kill POW.

68
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,360
Now, keep begging.

69
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,920
I might let you go, if you tried hard enough.

70
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,975
Just kill me.

71
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:09,960
You really want to die?

72
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,246
Here, let me help you.

73
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,191
Too bad,

74
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:22,834
I failed my mission.

75
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:47,926
Want to die?

76
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,213
Die another day!

77
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,561
Prince Wen, we've accomplished.

78
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:14,631
Like he said, to die with
dignity in a battle field.

79
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,240
You're AWOL.

80
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:18,428
Not exactly. Just playing dead.

81
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,620
My dad said, no shame for
living to fight another day,

82
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,080
only for being dead in vain.

83
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,873
Poor Third bro didn't listen to me.

84
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,140
He refused to play dead.

85
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,359
How much am I worth?

86
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:27,774
It doesn't hurt to tell you.

87
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,253
General alive: 5 acres of farm land.

88
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:31,812
5 acres.

89
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,420
I have a jade medal in possession.

90
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:39,444
How much is this broken thingy worth?

91
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,294
A lot.

92
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,646
I'll keep it as a gift.

93
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,319
But I don't believe you.

94
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,692
He's one of us. Still alive.

95
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,240
We were ambushed...

96
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,297
Anybody home?

97
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,685
Anybody home?

98
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:35,295
Somebody, bring me meatloaf and liquor!

99
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,299
A big shot like you,
what would you say now?

100
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,166
"Absurd!
Take him outside for beheading."

101
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,116
<i>Nothing to eat in here.</i>

102
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,750
General, spare me.

103
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,698
General, spare me.

104
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,798
Liang's archer and infantry unit;
2,000 men in total.

105
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,940
Ambushed our 1,000-strong elite unit.

106
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,080
Both sides were totally wiped out.

107
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,279
This is the sword I gave him.

108
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:49,098
But where is he now?

109
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,092
I believe we will find him.

110
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,186
Wu,

111
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,877
only if he's still among the living.

112
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,529
War is everywhere now,

113
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,030
where else you can go?

114
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,944
General, have you heard of Shen Shu?

115
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,862
The one in Mt. Phoenix?
A fortunate-telling tree.

116
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,664
Is he your captive?

117
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:21,530
He's my good luck.

118
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,930
Hang in there.
We're almost there.

119
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,928
How far?

120
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,932
2 days.

121
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:35,295
Small potato.

122
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,707
Don't make me do this.

123
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:39,721
Don't.

124
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,929
Don't push your luck.

125
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,286
Give me liquor.

126
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:50,457
No can do.

127
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,403
Liquor.

128
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:02,646
You've fought many battles, haven't you?

129
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:06,340
Many. You can say
I'm a big time warrior.

130
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,541
Untie me.

131
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,137
Then you must have killed a lot.

132
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,453
Just too many.

133
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:16,566
Fought against 8 men at a time.
Like yesterday.

134
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,545
General, would you take me too?

135
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,542
I'd like to become your captive.

136
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,742
Okay.

137
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,754
I know some musical.

138
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:39,302
General, keep drinking.
I'll entertain you.

139
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,076
If he turns out to be alive, what then?

140
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,606
Keep in mind that he's already dead.

141
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,442
Why?

142
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:50,077
General, you've killed so many.

143
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,799
I'm not a General.

144
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:58,937
My family were killed by yours.

145
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,657
And I live to sing against my will.

146
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:03,373
I'm supposed to give you a good time

147
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,612
and serve you, General.

148
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,549
I didn't take pleasure in
drinking with you.

149
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,203
Hey, no more fight.

150
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,878
Hey! Open the gate. I'm a soldier.

151
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,409
I have taken a Wei's General...

152
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:13,413
Stop.

153
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,359
Whose this head?

154
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,038
A General of Wei.

155
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,118
That's him. I'm sure.

156
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,888
That's a head of Wei's General.

157
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,610
Reward him.

158
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,412
Just a sec.

159
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,372
Who killed him?

160
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,591
I did.

161
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,395
You? Really?

162
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,718
He must be an AWOL.
Cut off a dead man's head.

163
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,885
Behead him.

164
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,422
That's not true!

165
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,227
You gonna have to kill me
if you don't let me go.

166
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:53,269
Or I'll kill you in a heart beat.

167
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:55,799
Kill, kill, kill.

168
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,370
I grow farms.

169
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,336
I don't kill and I don't want to kill.

170
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:02,330
You're getting me mad.

171
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:04,568
I'm not gonna kill you.

172
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,954
Can't believe I just got
fooled by some woman.

173
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,238
I gave her food to eat,
and she gave me pills to swallow.

174
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:15,027
You deceived her first,
so it sounds fair.

175
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,719
She should have hit you instead.

176
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,714
Stupid helmet.

177
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,299
What did she say to you last night?

178
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,593
You small potato.

179
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,107
Who's stronger, me or him?

180
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,290
He's a natural.

181
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,414
So I'm nowhere to compete with him?

182
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,924
You're too soft and he got the heart.

183
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:50,333
To become the King,
you must learn from him.

184
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:53,652
I'll take a unit and head for Liang's.
Why don't you go back...

185
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:56,374
I won't go back until I see him.

186
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,320
You know what,

187
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:00,655
I've been looking forward

188
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:02,506
to life of peace and farms

189
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,547
to grow for 20 years.

190
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:38,126
The wagon is not here.

191
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,353
Stop playing dead.
I'm too smart for that.

192
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:42,938
We better stay away
from the main road.

193
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,692
Let's take a detour.

194
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:46,406
Like this track.

195
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:48,994
Just don't lose the map.

196
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,597
Strong liquor. Must be Liang's.

197
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:03,171
<i>One small track
leads home.</i>

198
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:15,807
What now?

199
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,483
Like my dad said, step in shit.
Something good awaits me.

200
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:22,381
It's an ambush.

201
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,617
Yeah, right.

202
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:33,260
What's loaded on that wagon?

203
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,333
Nothing particular.

204
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:35,795
Rip him.

205
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:38,285
Rip him off!

206
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,974
- Wait, wait...
- Who are you?

207
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:46,825
A General.

208
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:51,245
Says you.

209
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,596
Beat him.

210
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,077
Beat him down.

211
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,264
Stop!

212
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,948
Stop! Stop!

213
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,574
Sorry.

214
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,867
Please... stop.

215
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,826
Take whatever you want,
just let us go.

216
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:17,776
What possibly do you have,

217
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:18,897
besides this piece of junk?

218
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,067
I want revenge!

219
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:21,966
Shut your mouth!

220
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,076
Who's this guy?

221
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,176
He?

222
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,025
He... he's my son.

223
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:30,408
No! I'm not his son...

224
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:31,636
You little prick!

225
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,235
He's crazy. He thinks he's going to war.

226
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:37,406
I'm taking him back to grow farms.

227
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:39,597
Grow farms? There's nothing left
to grow because of the wars.

228
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,670
Revenge!

229
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,812
I'm in charge here.
I say we take the wagon.

230
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,478
Unfaithful prick!

231
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:52,549
You got a death wish?
This helmet will get you killed.

232
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:53,573
How about this?

233
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:55,569
This? Will you ever learn?

234
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,806
Let's go!

235
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,716
Bunch of fools.

236
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:19,067
They had no idea you're the MVP
"Most Valuable Package" here.

237
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:23,730
Your son?

238
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:25,434
I'm gonna treat you good!

239
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,188
So tie me up and

240
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:31,171
take me back to your farms!

241
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,076
Don't move. Don't breathe.

242
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,662
You were trying to
strangle me to death?

243
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,850
If it wasn't me...

244
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,506
Prick!

245
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,989
It's not Dim Mak.

246
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:08,634
My dad was right.
I stepped in shit.

247
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,062
Pretty good.

248
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,102
Don't hurt us. I'm begging you!

249
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,349
Hold it there.

250
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,581
I could kill him,
or I could spare him.

251
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,720
I just have the power.

252
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:55,147
1 acre for growing beans.
1 acre for melons.

253
00:27:55,926 --> 00:28:00,004
How about 2 acres for beans,
2 acres for white grains?

254
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,356
No! 3 acres for beans.

255
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:19,468
Tell me, what I should do with
5 acres of farmland?

256
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,088
I can offer you a thousand acres.

257
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:22,654
That's too much.

258
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,767
I couldn't handle that much.

259
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,546
White grain or bean,
what to grow?

260
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,239
I'd say rice. I love rice.

261
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:39,808
White grain and rice are
the same thing, fool!

262
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,878
You tired?

263
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:45,113
Feeling comfy, right?

264
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:58,884
Now I'm relieved.

265
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,202
5 acres, I'd be working
my butt off.

266
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:05,504
Right, I'll need some buffalo.

267
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:09,136
One male, one female.

268
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,440
The male will work in the farms.
The female will give milk.

269
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:14,728
I'm dying to know how you're gonna
drag me all the way to Liang's.

270
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:16,434
Wait, I can't milk a cow.

271
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:19,934
So I'll need a wife who can do that.

272
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:26,148
My eldest brother was a great warrior.

273
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:28,096
He fought till death.

274
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,932
My second brother was a honest person.

275
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,868
He died on the battlefield as well.

276
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,936
I'm the last seed of the family.

277
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:44,116
General, do you have any siblings?

278
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:47,128
Wish I hadn't.

279
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,026
Why are you taking me here?

280
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,671
I couldn't find 'em.

281
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,822
The Mt. Phoenix is huge!
There's a lot of grounds to cover...

282
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,381
Was he being tied up?

283
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,512
Yes, his dad tied him up.
Said he's crazy or something...

284
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:18,398
They both appeared to be crazy...

285
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:22,246
Can I go back now?

286
00:30:41,363 --> 00:30:43,795
Revenge...

287
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:59,324
They want to take you back from me?
It's not gonna be easy.

288
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,193
I've been in battles for years,

289
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:06,370
never seen an
elegant arrow like this one.

290
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,792
I've seen this.
It's someone not friendly.

291
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:16,230
People like you just asking this
for yourself.

292
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:20,892
You know, they have you
and you'll die.

293
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:24,001
I have you and you'll live.

294
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,949
You are right.

295
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,088
I don't want to die in vain.

296
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,149
I'll come with you.

297
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:37,296
Turns out General is afraid of death.

298
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,435
If I die, I'll die with dignity.

299
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,520
This way, or that way?

300
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,366
Even if we make it to Liang's,
I could make a truce

301
00:31:57,564 --> 00:31:59,216
with one condition: your execution.

302
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:01,452
Don't fool me.
Nobody fools me.

303
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,689
Except that woman who drugged you.

304
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,072
You have lots of women?

305
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:10,991
Let's talk about you.
What type of women you like?

306
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,519
We have the lustful,

307
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:17,113
and the educated.

308
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:19,885
I like the honest ones.

309
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:24,546
But I'd probably take the educated.
She could teach me how to read.

310
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:35,028
You don't have a woman, right?

311
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:40,223
That woman, what did she say to you?

312
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:43,672
I'll tell you, if you can make it
back to Liang's.

313
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:45,917
You guys, go down there.

314
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,349
Back to where we came.
Keep a lookout.

315
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:03,706
Who is that?

316
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:08,369
The Others.
They're bound to their own rules.

317
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,896
Go make your acquaintance.

318
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:12,211
They don't speak our language.

319
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:14,642
They are passionate people.
Good fighters too.

320
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,588
Better stay away from 'em.

321
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,373
Hurry up, you don't look that tired.

322
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:33,878
Birds are gathering around,
but Phoenixes don't go with the flow.

323
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,345
What chicken and ducks
are you talking about?

324
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:42,083
If a phoenix lost its fur,
it'd make a chicken look elegant.

325
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,339
You're good at throwing rocks.

326
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:53,738
I used to hunt wild chicken
with rocks when I was a boy.

327
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:59,032
You know why our troops camped
at the Mt. Phoenix?

328
00:33:59,182 --> 00:34:00,445
How would I know?

329
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:03,509
Nevertheless, we had hidden there
for 2 days waiting for you.

330
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,103
That's what I thought, a set up.

331
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:09,677
If it wasn't an ambush,

332
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,547
my elite unit would have
crushed you majorly

333
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:16,044
and conquered Liang.

334
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:21,866
Stop the nonsense.
We are not that weak.

335
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:26,240
Anyway, an AWOL like you,
it's a shame to Liang.

336
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,706
Now, see how elite
you say you are.

337
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,489
General versus AWOL private?

338
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,927
Liang versus Wei. Fair and simple.

339
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:03,325
You want fair?
Keep your hands off my wound.

340
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,268
You have your wish.

341
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,406
You're dead.

342
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,872
Ha! You're dead too.
We're both dead.

343
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,200
Pervert.

344
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,247
War is over. Wei won.

345
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:47,104
Wars have been around these years.
More people have joined the military.

346
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:48,712
He kills him, and he gets killed by him.

347
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,320
What's the attraction?

348
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:55,271
Liang wins. Liang wins.

349
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,341
You call this fair?

350
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:01,160
It's war.
No such thing as being fair.

351
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:16,393
We'll soon have meat to eat.
Now, have some appetizer.

352
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:26,490
Lost your appetite?

353
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:29,850
Fine by me.

354
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,040
General, what do you eat when
there is no war to go to?

355
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:45,770
Meat and seafood.

356
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,607
Any good food you can
possibly think of.

357
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,791
Now I get it. You people constantly
go to war just because of digestion problems.

358
00:37:57,382 --> 00:37:59,080
Didn't you say you can't read?

359
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:06,607
My dad taught me these 2 words.
They are the easiest to write.

360
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:13,169
These 2 words...
are not easy at all.

361
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:15,840
Why don't you go to Wei with me.

362
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:18,416
I can offer you a high position.

363
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:19,830
I forgot to tell you one thing.

364
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:23,717
General alive, the rewards will be farmland
and money. No more serving in military.

365
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:26,633
There will be no more killing for me.
Just me and the farms.

366
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:29,551
When there's a war, there's a winner.

367
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:33,871
A winner of unification of China.
Only that will put an end to wars.

368
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,177
Only that will give you small potato
a normal life.

369
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,406
You know what,

370
00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:39,768
we could have
lived our normal life,

371
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:42,151
if you had just left us alone!

372
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:48,025
You really don't want a bite?

373
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:51,592
Frankly, I'm a bit hungry.

374
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,372
Here comes our meat!

375
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,386
Wonderful meat.

376
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,956
Hey! I'll get you firewood.

377
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,369
You have babies. Can't eat you.

378
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,605
My dad said...

379
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:48,206
Let's go. Let's go!

380
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,539
Someone is coming. Let's go!

381
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,453
What's the panic?
He's alone.

382
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,041
It's our guy.

383
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,915
Hey, bro...

384
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:33,639
Bastard!

385
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:59,416
<i>You. Go that way.</i>

386
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,172
<i>A Liang-made sword.</i>

387
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,273
On your Knees.

388
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,608
I'm a Liang's soldier.
I only knee to Liang's superiors.

389
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,375
What now?

390
00:41:58,572 --> 00:41:59,837
You are a scout from Liang's.

391
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:00,775
Yes.

392
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:01,570
What about you?

393
00:42:01,718 --> 00:42:02,499
I'm a scout too.

394
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:03,621
What are you scouting for?

395
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,178
I'm going to the battlefield
at Mt. Phoenix. No...

396
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,931
No survivors found.

397
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:08,414
Why taking small track?

398
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,828
Your convoy is taking the main road...

399
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:11,533
Track is faster...

400
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:13,235
pretty fast.

401
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:14,658
I don't know him.

402
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:18,009
What? He's got lightheaded
after falling off from a horse.

403
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:21,078
No... Yes, I fell...

404
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:22,589
Either way I just don't know you.

405
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,437
What?

406
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:27,125
You don't kill scouts. That's against
the tready among the states.

407
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:28,928
Is this your sword?

408
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:29,805
Yes.

409
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:31,947
Why you're carrying
a General type sword?

410
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:33,505
I borrowed it...

411
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,070
You're not a scout.

412
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:38,714
No, I'm not.

413
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:40,284
Where is the Wei's General?

414
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:41,758
I don't know.

415
00:42:41,956 --> 00:42:43,364
Don't you lie to me!

416
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:45,892
I know, I know.

417
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,613
I've got your General.

418
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:50,124
You got balls.

419
00:42:52,746 --> 00:42:53,682
I got no balls!

420
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,852
Where is he?

421
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,827
He's fled.

422
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:56,960
You're no use to us then.

423
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,149
No. No. I hid him.

424
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,428
Take us to him.

425
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:01,549
He really is gone.

426
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,009
Are you messing with me?

427
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:11,068
Back off! You all back off!

428
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:13,061
Back off!

429
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,195
Stay back!

430
00:43:25,294 --> 00:43:26,752
If I die, you won't get anything.

431
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:28,311
What do you want?

432
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:32,050
Rewards.

433
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:34,386
I can give you that.

434
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,523
Shame on you.

435
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:44,196
One of you is useless to me.

436
00:44:05,494 --> 00:44:07,681
What now?

437
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,137
Mount on! Get him!

438
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:17,254
Pardon me.

439
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,140
Wu.

440
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:25,657
Stand down.

441
00:45:28,488 --> 00:45:30,092
Let them through.

442
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,522
He's still alive, isn't he?

443
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:44,146
Pretty good.

444
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:47,449
Just a General, not a big deal.

445
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,996
Maybe I'd capture their King later.

446
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,715
Am I really a shame to Liang?

447
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,648
Am I?

448
00:47:12,214 --> 00:47:13,478
Come on.

449
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:17,655
Come get me!

450
00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:26,828
I'm not dead yet.
<i>Didn't expect that, right?</i>

451
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:28,482
<i>Because of your conspiracy,</i>

452
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:31,642
<i>1,000 brave men got killed.</i>

453
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:35,722
<i>They'll haunt you
for the rest of your life!</i>

454
00:47:36,743 --> 00:47:38,248
And you.

455
00:47:39,244 --> 00:47:41,913
A pity man.

456
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:45,374
<i>A dishonorable AWOL.</i>

457
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,676
One main road leads home

458
00:47:48,872 --> 00:47:51,981
empty-handed!

459
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,557
Where you come from?

460
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:10,521
Where's your home?

461
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,192
<i>When I fulfill the conquest</i>

462
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:16,546
<i>I'll start building my big boat.</i>

463
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:20,489
Yeah. I'm gonna sail off
on the night of the full moon

464
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:22,871
and travel the whole world.

465
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:24,867
My father said,

466
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:29,285
paint a dragon on the big boat,
and it'll attract a phoenix.

467
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:32,297
Prince, the day you are crowned,
you'll get anything you want.

468
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:36,186
To become a King, me and him
we'd never be the same again.

469
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:38,956
Take some rest, Prince.

470
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,344
My dad said, a sparrow could
one day become a phoenix.

471
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:47,599
Pretty good.

472
00:49:38,098 --> 00:49:39,420
Why did you trick me?

473
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,029
And I've also hit you.

474
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,733
So kill me, General.

475
00:49:43,754 --> 00:49:45,793
I'm not a General.
I'm a private.

476
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,097
What's the difference?
You just kill.

477
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:53,661
Hey, you're lost, right?

478
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,413
You really think that when you get to
Shen Shu, everything will be all right?

479
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,287
I'm a small potato.

480
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,483
this map I have here,

481
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:13,276
will get you to Shen Shu.

482
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,811
You'll get a lot of grounds to cover.
Take this horse with you.

483
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,304
I give this back to you.

484
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:51,661
You hungry? Me too.

485
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:54,586
Need to find something to eat.

486
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:24,797
<i>At the bottom of the mountain.
Soils are rich.</i>

487
00:51:26,304 --> 00:51:34,791
<i>5 acres of farmland</i>

488
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,059
<i>- You're wrong.</i>

489
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:37,957
<i>- You're wrong.</i>

490
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:42,825
If you want to be a successful diplomat,
you still need one more thing.

491
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:44,579
What's that?

492
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:45,749
Patience.

493
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:48,915
Mister, please tell me which way is Wei.

494
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:50,047
That way.

495
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:53,604
No, that way.

496
00:51:54,627 --> 00:51:58,170
<i>Wei has geographical advantages,
with Liang acting like a front shield,</i>

497
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,845
<i>and Chu like a shield on the back.</i>

498
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:05,612
<i>You can run, but you can't hide.</i>

499
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:45,687
This is your new home now.

500
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,506
I'm going home too.

501
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:55,155
You live a good life.

502
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:00,983
Pretty good.

503
00:54:47,556 --> 00:54:53,379
<i>One main road leads home</i>

504
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:59,202
<i>My home is right at
the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

505
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:02,894
<i>Soils are rich there...</i>

506
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,462
Pretty good.

507
00:55:10,082 --> 00:55:11,394
Pretty good.

508
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:21,636
Easy, easy.

509
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:27,172
I should have killed you in that inn.

510
00:55:27,368 --> 00:55:30,134
I should have let you
be the black bear's lunch.

511
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:34,409
Don't get too tight, you catch my drift?

512
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,560
They're taking us to a tomb.

513
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:38,069
Tomb?

514
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,434
Get us buried in mass grave.

515
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:40,897
Buried?

516
00:55:53,171 --> 00:55:55,161
How far is Liang from here?

517
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,883
1 day if you take the river.

518
00:55:58,179 --> 00:55:59,832
What village you come from?

519
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:01,401
Three Legs Cave.

520
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,317
Looks like your plan isn't going well.

521
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:07,914
We'll see. You're still my captive.

522
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:10,828
Hey, I'm not your captive!

523
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:13,162
I'm his captive!

524
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:49,075
Trade him with a horse.

525
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:58,879
Prince, look out!

526
00:58:19,157 --> 00:58:20,469
Defense!

527
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:55,157
How to take this thing off?

528
00:58:55,308 --> 00:58:56,620
I'm about to ask you the same question.

529
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,967
Wu!

530
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:04,841
I have an idea.

531
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:05,914
Just say it.

532
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,201
Remember, we're in the same boat.

533
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:11,406
Yes, like my dad said,

534
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:14,033
Whether it's a an eagle or a chicken,
they are just meat once placed in a hotpot.

535
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:16,123
Figured.

536
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,734
Need help.

537
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:58,979
Not a perfect plan... but still a good idea.

538
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:41,558
Wu.

539
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,214
Yes.

540
01:01:45,926 --> 01:01:47,480
You finally fight me with a real sword.

541
01:01:47,677 --> 01:01:50,590
Sorry, you're no longer my master now.

542
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,064
What a pity,
you're my best student ever.

543
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:24,848
Get on it.

544
01:02:27,713 --> 01:02:29,268
Buffalo, faster.

545
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,809
Prince, make your way out.

546
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:01,828
This way.

547
01:04:01,978 --> 01:04:04,263
That way.

548
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:09,264
Hey, you know what,
I didn't want to save you.

549
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:12,274
This buffalo just lost his temper.

550
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,985
Was this buffalo too power

551
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:18,885
or the wall was too weak?

552
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,657
Not matter what, thank you.

553
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:23,748
Pretty good. Pretty good.

554
01:04:25,206 --> 01:04:26,373
What's with your waist belt?

555
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:29,531
My secret.

556
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,351
Before we go separate ways,
I'll have a secret to tell.

557
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:35,848
You want to know why those people
wanted to capture me?

558
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,175
No, I don't want to know.

559
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,850
People like you are so complicated.

560
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,864
Since the day we met,
everything has become complicated.

561
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:45,677
Small potato!

562
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:47,523
You're still my POW.

563
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:49,434
Can't let you walk out on me!

564
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,135
You've delayed my business.

565
01:04:53,235 --> 01:04:54,794
You're my business.

566
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:00,670
Wei's General
I know, I'm your farmland.

567
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:03,829
Yes, 5 acres of it.

568
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:05,981
And the reward money.

569
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:08,559
Yes, a pocketful of it.

570
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:12,552
Why?

571
01:05:12,752 --> 01:05:13,626
I'm ordering you!

572
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:15,381
You can't trick me!

573
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,373
Thanks for the warning...

574
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:40,662
This can't hold any longer.

575
01:05:41,294 --> 01:05:42,414
Get off of my back.

576
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,682
Not a chance.

577
01:05:43,879 --> 01:05:45,387
I'll grab you after you let go of me.

578
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:47,479
You think I'd buy that?

579
01:05:48,064 --> 01:05:49,379
Let's find out.

580
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:07,725
Wu.

581
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:11,030
Prince.

582
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:14,721
Why?

583
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:20,793
He's still alive. Is that fate?

584
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,798
Prince, let's head back to Wei.

585
01:06:22,996 --> 01:06:25,912
No! You don't know how I feel.

586
01:06:47,506 --> 01:06:48,819
You really are some piece of work.

587
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:57,120
Go ahead. Tie me up.

588
01:06:58,236 --> 01:07:00,043
Just take a look around.

589
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,740
Take a look around at this hell hole!

590
01:07:15,482 --> 01:07:16,941
Where are we?

591
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:32,916
Save your breath.
We're gonna die down here.

592
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:48,060
<i>One main road leads home</i>

593
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:54,813
<i>My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

594
01:07:56,803 --> 01:07:59,715
<i>Soils are rich there</i>

595
01:07:59,912 --> 01:08:01,467
You're losing it.

596
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:04,736
Pretty good. My dad said,

597
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:08,430
as long as you still alive,
it's pretty good.

598
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:09,938
Must I become the King?

599
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:13,635
You'll be a good King.
It's a good thing for Wei.

600
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:17,338
Are you trying to convince me
to kill him without a blink of an eye?

601
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:20,933
We've gone this far,
this is the only way out.

602
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:24,249
Okay, how can he die

603
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,939
with dignity?

604
01:08:29,154 --> 01:08:30,617
What are you thinking?

605
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,531
Rapeseed flower.

606
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:38,246
I'm thinking about growing rapeseed.

607
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:39,514
Why?

608
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:40,683
Why what?

609
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,020
Why am I being stuck
in a place like this?

610
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,986
I should be the one who brings
all the Dukes to their knees.

611
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:50,563
And then have a huge tomb
made for me.

612
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:53,773
Have my own treasure
buried with me.

613
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,271
Now they can't even
find my corpse.

614
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:03,775
Yeah, the rest of reward money
would go to my new pharmacy store.

615
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:06,599
To be honest, your drugs worked.

616
01:09:07,718 --> 01:09:10,827
I'm appointing you as
The Minister for Health.

617
01:09:16,212 --> 01:09:20,485
You know what, if it wasn't the wars,
we could have been buddies.

618
01:09:21,654 --> 01:09:23,207
Perhaps.

619
01:09:24,813 --> 01:09:26,756
If you make it out alive,

620
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:30,691
will you promise me one thing?

621
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:32,152
Shoot.

622
01:09:34,386 --> 01:09:36,960
Never invade my nation, Liang.

623
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:48,757
I give you 10 years of truce.

624
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:53,565
Sounds tricky.
You have an agreement.

625
01:09:57,797 --> 01:09:59,740
And you need to promise me one thing.

626
01:09:59,938 --> 01:10:00,671
Shoot.

627
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,761
If you ever make it out alive,

628
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:05,581
you must tell them that

629
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,320
I died fighting.

630
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,963
I died fighting for my people.

631
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:16,232
I've done nothing disgraceful
to Wei.

632
01:10:17,728 --> 01:10:23,458
We all bite the dust,
but not our flag.

633
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:27,789
Don't lie to me,

634
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,706
you small potato.

635
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:35,514
Being a small potato...

636
01:12:22,943 --> 01:12:24,843
sounds pretty good.

637
01:12:44,058 --> 01:12:48,135
Dad, I'm alive!

638
01:12:49,303 --> 01:12:51,295
Thanks Heaven!

639
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,115
Thanks Heaven!

640
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:58,498
You know what, this is
Three Legs Cave.

641
01:12:58,645 --> 01:13:01,089
There is a fisherman's village nearby.
I'll go get a boat.

642
01:13:01,384 --> 01:13:02,742
It'll take half a day to get there.

643
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:04,400
To where?

644
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:07,074
To Liang, where else could it be?

645
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:12,321
<i>Don't think about running away.
You can't survive an hour without me.</i>

646
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,226
Quick, quick!

647
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,220
Go hide!

648
01:13:24,418 --> 01:13:25,584
Hide from what?

649
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,289
Just hide.

650
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,077
Help me up.

651
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,351
Little brother.

652
01:13:41,326 --> 01:13:43,172
Little brother?

653
01:13:44,582 --> 01:13:46,232
He's your brother?

654
01:13:46,383 --> 01:13:48,908
You've been chasing me for days.
Don't you get tired?

655
01:13:49,118 --> 01:13:50,042
Prince.

656
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,455
Prince?

657
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:53,160
Why the mourning bandana?

658
01:13:53,408 --> 01:13:54,963
It's for our father.

659
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:58,172
He was very sick when
I left for battles. It's you.

660
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:01,825
It's fate. You just cared about
waging wars to please the old man.

661
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,889
If I hadn't upset him by making
peace arrangement with Liang,

662
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,745
I would have been the Prince.

663
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:09,517
You set the ambush to make sure
I'd get killed.

664
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:11,815
Something going on between you two

665
01:14:12,013 --> 01:14:13,910
and we Liang paid with 2,000 lives.

666
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:15,371
You're not authorized to talk to me.

667
01:14:15,568 --> 01:14:17,513
You're not authorized to talk to me.

668
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,184
Leave him out of this.

669
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,412
But he's the enemy.

670
01:14:21,563 --> 01:14:23,264
He wants me to live,
but you wants me to die.

671
01:14:23,462 --> 01:14:28,220
Come on. Use that crossbow I gave you
and claim the throne of Wei.

672
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:37,591
You're still too soft-hearted.

673
01:14:40,648 --> 01:14:45,748
Your sword. If you don't kill him, he will kill you.

674
01:14:46,814 --> 01:14:48,877
Only one of you will become the King.

675
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:55,674
That's doesn't make any sense,
why one of you brothers must die?

676
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:56,699
It's none of your business.

677
01:14:56,848 --> 01:14:59,083
You guys are complicating things.

678
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:00,689
I said "it's none of your business!"

679
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:03,654
It's all because of that nosy baldhead.

680
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:07,785
I'm done talking.

681
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,248
He really looks upset.
Maybe we should go now.

682
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,748
I'm really messed up big time.

683
01:15:30,896 --> 01:15:34,150
You do what you got to do, Master.

684
01:15:55,995 --> 01:15:57,210
Hey, can we go now?

685
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:23,657
General!

686
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,602
Behind you!

687
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,608
It's none of my business.

688
01:17:37,365 --> 01:17:39,599
What a pity.

689
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,666
Not even one small rock?

690
01:18:52,848 --> 01:18:54,547
Don't get any closer,

691
01:18:54,745 --> 01:18:57,135
or you'd get blind.

692
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,345
<i>Big brother!</i>

693
01:20:07,221 --> 01:20:08,680
Stop!

694
01:20:12,419 --> 01:20:14,123
I'm the one you should kill.

695
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:17,766
I'm the one you should kill.

696
01:20:19,033 --> 01:20:21,559
Me and my brother,

697
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,604
only one will walk out here alive.

698
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:28,026
You don't understand
what I'm saying, do you?

699
01:20:33,514 --> 01:20:35,700
How about this?

700
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:37,502
This is what I got to do.

701
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:40,422
<i>Little brother!</i>

702
01:20:46,103 --> 01:20:50,814
Big brother, am I dying with dignity?

703
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:56,937
Sorry about our big boat.

704
01:20:57,814 --> 01:21:01,213
We can never build it together.

705
01:21:49,235 --> 01:21:50,548
Do me a favor.

706
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:53,864
Help me bury him.

707
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:04,111
We must carry on, General.
We got half day.

708
01:22:05,038 --> 01:22:08,342
Sorry, I mean Prince.

709
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:16,258
Your Wei's liquor is not strong enough.

710
01:22:18,545 --> 01:22:20,729
I know what you're thinking.

711
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:22,532
I also know what you're thinking.

712
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:29,966
- Pretty good.
- We're still alive.

713
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,822
You two reminded me

714
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:36,780
of my own brothers.

715
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:38,435
They were good soldiers.

716
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:40,871
In fact,
I wanted to be a good soldier.

717
01:22:42,328 --> 01:22:46,313
The first time we enlisted,
we 3 brothers got no choice.

718
01:22:46,559 --> 01:22:48,745
The first tour lasted for 3 years.

719
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:50,656
When we came back,

720
01:22:51,629 --> 01:22:53,718
our village had been burnt to ground.

721
01:22:54,596 --> 01:22:56,005
We became homeless.

722
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,322
Before my dad died, he told us

723
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:03,019
we had served our country.

724
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:09,365
But when the wars will end?

725
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,390
And he said, "kids, listen,

726
01:23:18,454 --> 01:23:20,883
one of you 3 brothers must live,

727
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:27,828
in order to raise kids for our family."

728
01:23:30,115 --> 01:23:32,980
Now I'm the only one left.

729
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:41,961
Having you is my biggest luck ever.

730
01:23:50,221 --> 01:23:55,029
I can't say the same thing about my luck.

731
01:24:11,008 --> 01:24:12,418
Don't ask.

732
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:15,388
What she said to me the other night:

733
01:24:17,088 --> 01:24:18,886
"kama".

734
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,068
What a little potato.

735
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:47,211
"Peace"

736
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:03,816
"Mt. Liang"

737
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:07,123
You know what,
after this turn is Liang's soil.

738
01:25:12,516 --> 01:25:16,209
My brother wanted to befriend
Liang, maybe he's right.

739
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:17,927
If Liang's Duke spare my life, may be we could

740
01:25:18,124 --> 01:25:19,885
work something out for allying each other.

741
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:21,452
Maybe, maybe.

742
01:25:23,508 --> 01:25:25,160
Maybe it's too late.

743
01:25:26,086 --> 01:25:27,639
Maybe.

744
01:25:42,949 --> 01:25:44,992
Nothing feels like home!

745
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:51,116
That's your secret belt...

746
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,301
I was wrong about you.

747
01:26:03,276 --> 01:26:06,046
Never thought you could make
this journey for both of us.

748
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:10,777
Now, am I your captive or enemy?

749
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,456
Neither. Just go.

750
01:26:23,034 --> 01:26:25,577
Hurry. Before I change my mind.

751
01:26:30,196 --> 01:26:31,561
Why?

752
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:36,185
You 2 brothers...  one must live.

753
01:26:47,623 --> 01:26:49,227
Can I count on your word?

754
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:51,089
What you mean?

755
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,089
10 years of truce!

756
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:56,692
Absolutely!
You have my word!

757
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,638
Don't forget...

758
01:27:03,128 --> 01:27:06,142
that medal you took from me,
it's worth a fortunate.

759
01:27:06,777 --> 01:27:10,228
It can get your farmland and money.

760
01:27:11,837 --> 01:27:13,494
I found it.

761
01:27:16,363 --> 01:27:18,213
I might not live long enough...

762
01:27:20,457 --> 01:27:23,815
Now I'm empty-handed.
Pretty good.

763
01:27:27,245 --> 01:27:29,046
<i>Run.</i>

764
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:32,649
Run away now.

765
01:28:14,017 --> 01:28:15,624
Ask him to surrender.

766
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:20,194
Liang has been destroyed.
Knee down and surrender.

767
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,583
Liang is gone?

768
01:28:25,804 --> 01:28:27,122
How could that possible?

769
01:28:27,323 --> 01:28:30,347
Liang refused to surrender.
So we, from Qin, destroyed it.

770
01:28:30,692 --> 01:28:34,397
- Your units have been completely eliminated.
- On your knee. Last chance.

771
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,355
All units wiped out?

772
01:28:36,846 --> 01:28:38,896
No more Liang.

773
01:28:39,983 --> 01:28:42,472
No more Liang.

774
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,678
No more Liang.

775
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,034
I really got nothing left now.

776
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:14,216
Put the flag down.

777
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,826
<i>One main road</i>

778
01:29:24,466 --> 01:29:25,984
Your units have been wiped out.

779
01:29:26,082 --> 01:29:27,256
That's not entirely true.

780
01:29:27,307 --> 01:29:29,365
Drop your sword.

781
01:29:30,312 --> 01:29:32,363
I'm still standing!
Give your best shot!

782
01:29:32,462 --> 01:29:40,810
<i>My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

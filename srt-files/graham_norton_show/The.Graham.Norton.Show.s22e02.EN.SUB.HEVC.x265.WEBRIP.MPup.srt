00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#ffffff"> This programme contains  some strong language.</font>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And it's my absolute pleasure to say  welcome to the Graham Norton Show!</font>

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Oh, the anticipation -  I'm on tenterhooks.</font>

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I'm like Meghan Markle waiting  to find an engagement</font>

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> But can I just say,  what a lovely week it's been</font>

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> for our Prime Minister,  Theresa May!</font>

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,989
<font color="#ffffff"> than with a huge  party...conference.</font>

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,989
<font color="#ffffff"> First of all, to be fair,  she did have a very sore throat.</font>

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> That can happen when you are going  "No! " at poor people.</font>

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Did you see that bit  where her speech was interrupted</font>

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You know, that guy that turns up  at events and behaves like a twat?</font>

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:57,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Boris is now favourite to be  the next Prime Minister.</font>

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I say favourite, it's like deciding  which STI you'd prefer.</font>

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And to cap everything off,  did you see the letter F come loose</font>

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,989
<font color="#ffffff"> from her party slogan  while she was talking?</font>

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You really know things have gone  tits-up when even your own</font>

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Later we'll have music  and chat from rock and roll</font>

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,989
<font color="#ffffff"> But first - he's a Grammy and Emmy  award-winning stand-up</font>

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,989
<font color="#ffffff"> He's back on our shores  with his new show, Total Blackout.</font>

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,989
<font color="#ffffff"> It's a warm welcome back  to the brilliant Chris Rock!</font>

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> This Hackney heartthrob rose to fame  as Stringer Bell in The Wire and has</font>

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> gone on to play roles as diverse  as Nelson Mandela and</font>

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And starring with Idris  in The Mountain Between Us is one</font>

24

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:49,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Long time no see. You were backstage  hanging out, shooting the breeze.</font>

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Chris and Kate, do you know each  other? Not at all. Always admired</font>

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Kate and her work. Likewise. She's  the only white woman celebrity with</font>

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,989

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Quite an accomplishment. Just you.  Only one. No, my word. People point</font>

<font color="#ffffff"> in the street. Wow! Beautiful  children. Somebody giving white kids</font>

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> but was your first time meeting at  the Baftas? It was, yeah. We met at</font>

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the Baftas and we presented  together, it was at the beginning of</font>

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,989
<font color="#ffffff"> last year I think. This picture, do  you know this, it became a kind of</font>

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,989
<font color="#ffffff"> meme on the Internet. Idris knows!  What did I do wrong? My favourite</font>

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> was, if Kate Winslet had held onto  Leo as hard as she's holding onto</font>

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Idris, he might not have died!  LAUGHTER</font>

<font color="#ffffff"> You know what, I don't know him know  him, but are used to see Trump at</font>

46
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> clubs and stuff. I was at this  place, the China club in New York</font>

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and Trump would come in with a suit  on and girls would be all over him,</font>

48
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> like I'm going to... Donald Trump!  It was like 20 years ago, they would</font>

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,989
<font color="#ffffff"> be all over him. Wow! A bunch of  girls would be going, wow, Trump. He</font>

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,989

<font color="#ffffff"> the Obamas, you were at the famous  last White House party.</font>

52
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I was there.  It was scary.</font>

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I remember I...  I just remember like, hanging out.</font>

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> First of all, every  black person was there.</font>

55
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Jay Z, Beyonce, Oprah,  so it's like I'd died</font>

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and went to black heaven.  I remember, at one point</font>

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,989
<font color="#ffffff"> in the night, I was like,  with Michelle Obama and she was kind</font>

58
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> of sad, "I don't know  what we're going to do."</font>

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,989
<font color="#ffffff"> "I don't know what's  going to happen."</font>

60
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I was like, "You'll be all right!"  LAUGHTER</font>

61
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You know,  Housewives Of Atlanta, something.</font>

62
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,989
<font color="#ffffff"> LAUGHTER  "You'll get on something."</font>

63
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,989
<font color="#ffffff"> "You'll be fine."  And she looks at me and she goes,</font>

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> "I was talking about the country."  I've never felt</font>

65
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,989
<font color="#ffffff"> so stupid in my life.  And actually, Idris,</font>

66
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> we've got a picture of you,  here you are, in the White House.</font>

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Yes.  I met the man.</font>

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Oh, look.  It was great.</font>

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Sharing laughs.  Do you remember what you</font>

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,989
<font color="#ffffff"> were laughing about?  Yeah, exactly.</font>

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Was it about David Cameron?  LAUGHTER</font>

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,989
<font color="#ffffff"> No-one's talking  to him, he's just like...</font>

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> LAUGHTER  President Obama at the time</font>

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> was telling me I was his second  favourite character in The Wire.</font>

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Oh.  Omar, number one.</font>

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Yeah, Omar was his favourite  so I laughed out loud,</font>

77
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> as you can see, like  "Come on, man!".</font>

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Have you hung out in the White  House? No, I haven't. But I did meet</font>

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the Queen, does that count? Yes, it  does! Have you got a CBE? Yes. Why</font>

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,989
<font color="#ffffff"> weren't you fast tracked to Dame  Kate Winslet, it sounds right. No,</font>

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> it doesn't! Were you slightly  annoyed when you open the envelope</font>

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and it said CBE? It's definitely one  of those ones for the parents, my</font>

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,989
<font color="#ffffff"> parents were very excited. Is she a  fan, did she say that she loved you</font>

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> in something? She has the most  incredible skin, and beautiful</font>

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> bouncing hair. And there is a  system, she's very well rehearsed</font>

86
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and practised at this. You're told  what to do, you step forward and</font>

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,989
<font color="#ffffff"> curtsy or bow and she gives you a  suggestive nudge backwards, saying,</font>

88
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,989
<font color="#ffffff"> you're done, that's it! And then she  said, well, congratulations on your</font>

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> achievements. She said, you're a  mother, and she said, that is the</font>

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,989
<font color="#ffffff"> only job. And I thought, good lady,  I was really touched that she said</font>

91
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> that. And then she went... LAUGHTER  So, better get back to it! Fair</font>

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,989
<font color="#ffffff"> enough, I have to say. Kate and  Idris, you bring us a new movie, The</font>

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Mountain Between Us, opening  tonight. A rare thing, the romantic</font>

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,989
<font color="#ffffff"> survival movie! Wynne that's all  romance is!</font>

95
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,989
<font color="#ffffff"> That's all it is. There's the 60%!  So, it's an extraordinary story</font>

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> because you didn't really crash a  plane but you were really on the</font>

97
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,989
<font color="#ffffff"> mountain, for how long? How long  were we mounting for? On the</font>

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,989
<font color="#ffffff"> mountain! Press the red button.  Titles. The shoot was for about</font>

99
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,989
<font color="#ffffff"> seven weeks but the -38 stuff, we  were there for about four weeks,</font>

100
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,989
<font color="#ffffff"> give or take. Give or take, very  cold. You are sharing a small plane.</font>

101
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,989
<font color="#ffffff"> We are total strangers, they don't  know each other and they are trying</font>

102
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> to get from Idaho to New York. I'm a  photojournalist and Idris is</font>

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> performing a neurosurgery. They  charter a light aircraft together</font>

104
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and the plane goes down in bad  weather, the pilot is killed and</font>

105
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,989
<font color="#ffffff"> they crashed into the side of a  mountain and it's the story of how</font>

106
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the two of them try and get  themselves home. The two of you and</font>

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> a dog. Wonderful. The dog does very  well, I felt, no chapped lips,</font>

108
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> doesn't lose any weight. A glossy  coat and chasing balls at the end.</font>

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Incredible performance. Was it just  one dog? Yeah. And I just say, I</font>

110
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,989
<font color="#ffffff"> thought, please may this film not go  to the place where you're sitting by</font>

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the fire looking at the dog,  thinking... Relax. Didn't happen.</font>

112
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> But they did have sex with the dog!  We will whet your appetite now,</font>

113
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Chris. This is a clip from The  Mountain Between Us. Your character</font>

114
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> is a beery and sing something nice.  -- is experiencing some thin ice.</font>

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:13:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And that is really you? Yeah and it  was really Idris as well, funnily</font>

116
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,989
<font color="#ffffff"> enough. It was -30 eight. Yeah. You  kind of feel like, if you stick your</font>

117
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,989
<font color="#ffffff"> tongue outcome what is it like, do  your eyes stick together? Don't try</font>

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:36,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and take a piss. Crystals. Is it  little or is it one long bicycle? --</font>

119
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> icicle. It is,,, then you put it  away. Is it the same with ladies? It</font>

120
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> is but we have to get more of our  body out of clothes in order to be</font>

121
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> able to pee which is challenging but  I was delighted by the portapotty.</font>

122
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> The great thing about having a wee  and a poo is that it immediately</font>

123
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> freezes. You had a poo? We've all  been in one of those portaloos. You</font>

124
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> all had a shit at some point in the  film! You would go into this</font>

125
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,989
<font color="#ffffff"> portaloo and think, OK, fine, but  everything's fossilised. No wonder.</font>

126
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I can do this. How long were you in  the toilets for? Scientific. It's</font>

127
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,989
<font color="#ffffff"> easier for boys to wee and it is for  girls, so I tried to use the</font>

128
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> fossilised Porter party. And despite  the temperatures, romance blossoms.</font>

129
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Yes.  ALL: ooh!</font>

130
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Idris Elba.  We think of Idris Elba as a leading</font>

131
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,989
<font color="#ffffff"> man, as a ladies' man...  But you haven't actually done</font>

132
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,989
<font color="#ffffff"> that many love scenes?  No.</font>

133
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Why is that, how is that?  Umm...</font>

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Aah...  LAUGHTER.</font>

135
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> No, I just haven't  had the opportunity.</font>

136
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I've done a lot of films  where there's a lot of guys.</font>

137
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> No, that's not true.  That's no excuse!</font>

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> APPLAUSE.  How can I say it...</font>

139
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I just haven't been  in any romantic...</font>

140
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,989
<font color="#ffffff"> That would be a real good movie!  No, I'm not...!</font>

141
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Umm...  But, no.</font>

142
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> LAUGHTER.  It rose in the mountains,</font>

143
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> something like that!  But the director had never directed</font>

144
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,989
<font color="#ffffff"> a love scene, is this right?  Yeah, that's true.</font>

145
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,989
<font color="#ffffff"> So, "awkward"...  Kate Winslet...</font>

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I'm afraid I had to get quite bossy.  So, I've done a few of these</font>

147
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> kinds of scenes before.  So we get there and poor Hany,</font>

148
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> our director, he's such a lovely man  and he was really quite nervous.</font>

149
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And he had an extensive shot list  and I'm thinking, oh, my God,</font>

150
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> they're absolutely never  going to get all of this done.</font>

151
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> What kind of scene is this, anyway?  There was like 25 shots!</font>

152
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And Idris...  You were a little bit</font>

153
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> nervous, weren't you?  Not really, no!</font>

154
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Well, OK.  That was my game,</font>

155
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> to just get in there.  Deadly!</font>

156
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Everything was moving quite slowly  and I'm, like, look...</font>

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,989
<font color="#ffffff"> OK...  We need to really start filming</font>

158
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,989
<font color="#ffffff"> this, what's with all this chat?  And Hany said, actually,</font>

159
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I'm really kind of nervous,  I've never done this...</font>

160
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I really never have  shot like this before.</font>

161
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And Idris said, no, I've never done  much of it either, and I went...</font>

162
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> OK!  Put the camera over there and we're</font>

163
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> going to do this and we're  going to do that and then Idris</font>

164
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,989
<font color="#ffffff"> said, keep your socks on.  And I'm like, keep my socks on?</font>

165
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Everything else is off!  What's with the socks?</font>

166
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> No, I've got a foot thing.  I've got a thing.</font>

167
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You know?  LAUGHTER.</font>

168
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I didn't want the socks took off  and they were like...</font>

169
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Hobbit feet?  And I would be like...</font>

170
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> This was a moment.  Oh, my God!</font>

171
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> It's talon time!  Yes!</font>

172
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I've got very big feet  and they're not particularly</font>

173
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,989
<font color="#ffffff"> beautiful feet, either.  They're all right!</font>

174
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I shall keep them inside  the shoes that they are in.</font>

175
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Anyway...  So, I'm thinking, Idris doesn't</font>

176
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> want to see my feet because maybe  he just does not like feet</font>

177
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> in general and that's  the whole thing.</font>

178
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> It's the opposite,  ladies and gentlemen.</font>

179
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Idris LOVES feet!  Listen...</font>

180
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Everybody take your shoes off!  I can't wait to see this movie!</font>

181
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:42,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Chris, who directed yourself? In a  sex scene was Mike yes. That is</font>

182
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> funny! I had a ball! I had a lot of  balls! I had a great time, great</font>

183
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> girls, they were down, whatever. I  did direct myself. In between takes</font>

185
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Yes!  APPLAUSE.</font>

186
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> The interesting thing is Kate  Winslet, the all-American in the</font>

190
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> The truth is, I auditioned for this  for so long and they told me, don't</font>

238
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the early 90s, the late 80s. Not  Doctor Doolittle, the man with the</font>

241
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,989

242
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> around the gangsters. And this girl  says to Eddie Murphy, I love you so</font>

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> do dinner with Jack and Rose, how  can I pull this off? He said, we</font>

270
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> will do better, and his foundation,  which is completely unbelievable, he</font>

271
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> has an annual fundraiser in St  Tropez and I said we will auction</font>

272
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Jack and Rose for dinner. And we  will make those funds. And I thought</font>

273
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,989
<font color="#ffffff"> that would be incredible. And we  raised $1.35 million.</font>

274
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> APPLAUSE.  That is amazing! The Evening</font>

275
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Standard so quickly, it suddenly  happened and I could night -- could</font>

276
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> not quite work things out, we ended  up selling three separate dinners.</font>

277
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> What can I say? Did that include the  tip? It does include a life jacket.</font>

278
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> James Cameron very kindly... I  called him and I said can you send</font>

279
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> us a life jacket and he did, he sent  us a life jacket and we need another</font>

280
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> two! Jack and Rose and a life  jacket! You make it sound like a</font>

281
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> bargain! It sounds so lovely,  because the friendship between you</font>

282
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and Leonardo DiCaprio, it is real?  It is not just show business, you</font>

283
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,989
<font color="#ffffff"> went through so much? It really is  like family, jolly lucky to have</font>

284
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,989
<font color="#ffffff"> such an amazing friend. Such a  namedropper! He is probably so</font>

285
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,989
<font color="#ffffff"> completely sick of it! I love Leo!  Did you do Titanic material? No! I</font>

286
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,989
<font color="#ffffff"> don't do it now, I loved Titanic. It  was amazing! I was actually in the</font>

287
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> land! I played the violin! -- in the  band. We must mention another film</font>

288
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,989
<font color="#ffffff"> viewers, this is Woody Allen's  latest film. I am in that, also! It</font>

289
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,989
<font color="#ffffff"> is a period piece. It is set in 1950  in Coney Island and I play Jenny,</font>

290
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> she is an oyster bar waitress with a  lot of regrets in her life and is on</font>

291
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> her second marriage, living a life  she never imagined she would, her</font>

292
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> young son is apparent maniac and she  meets and falls in love with Mickey,</font>

293
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the lifeguard, played by Justin  Timberlake, and he also meets my</font>

294
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> stepdaughter, aged 22, younger and  wittier, and it starts to make for a</font>

295
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> rather strange and terrible things.  Woody Allen, he makes these movies,</font>

296
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,989
<font color="#ffffff"> he makes them and it's for quite a  low budget. Yes, they are very low</font>

297
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,989
<font color="#ffffff"> budget which is quite hilarious.  What happens, you end up sharing</font>

298
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,989
<font color="#ffffff"> trailers. I shared a trailer with  Justin Timberlake. It's a very hard</font>

299
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,989
<font color="#ffffff"> life! And I was sent up a mountain  with Idris Elba! Anyone else? There</font>

300
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,989
<font color="#ffffff"> was a tiny thin bit of plasterboard  partitioning between the different</font>

301
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,989
<font color="#ffffff"> ends of this small trailer. I would  take my own cattle in each day. I</font>

302
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,989
<font color="#ffffff"> would hear him weeing each morning.  "Morning, Justin Timberlake." And he</font>

303
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,989
<font color="#ffffff"> starts singing and then I think, I  quite like my life. Very cool. I</font>

304
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> don't think you're supposed to talk  through the partition, you're</font>

305
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> supposed to pretend it's solid. I  know! I heard everything! We've got</font>

306
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> a clip, Woody Allen chose it and  send it to us because the film comes</font>

307
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> out later this year. I knew I'd find  you here, why aren't you in school?</font>

308
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I wanted to see this picture. You  can't not go to school. Jesus,</font>

309
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Ritchie, this is why you're in  summer school. I don't like school.</font>

310
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Doesn't matter if you don't like it.  I don't like waiting on tables. Some</font>

311
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,989
<font color="#ffffff"> things you have to do whether you  like it or not. I want to watch the</font>

312
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,989
<font color="#ffffff"> picture. Where did you get the  money? I'd took 20 cents out of his</font>

313
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,989
<font color="#ffffff"> pants when he was asleep. You stole  from your father? He's not my father</font>

314
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and I hate him! Don't say that! He's  a good person. Why does he hit you?</font>

315
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> He doesn't hit me. When he gets  drunk he hits everybody but he</font>

316
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> hardly drink is any more. -- hardly  drinks.</font>

317
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Right, it's time to meet our  musical guest tonight.</font>

353
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,989
<font color="#ffffff"> it in. It's something you said you'd  never do, a solo album. Yeah because</font>

354
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I prefer to be in a band, know what  I mean? It's better when you're with</font>

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the lads, even though they are over  there. Now I've got to do all of</font>

357
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,989
<font color="#ffffff"> that's for sure. On the tour you are  going to be back in the band. Yeah.</font>

358
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> How quickly do the tourists sell  out? I think it was about maybe an</font>

359
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> hour -- the tours. As real good. Not  as fast as yours. The American one</font>

360
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,989
<font color="#ffffff"> is still going. You keep all of the  money, huh? Yeah, got a lot of</font>

361
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,989
<font color="#ffffff"> outtakes, know what I mean. Got to  play a lot of bills.</font>

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Making the record, here tonight you  got the strings. What have you got</font>

363
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> against saxophones? They're is a bit  creepy, a bit dim Faye, I think. You</font>

364
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> know something's going down. -- a  bit pervy. Somebody got it out and I</font>

365
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,989
<font color="#ffffff"> said, put it away, mate. He said, it  will sound like a guitar and I said,</font>

366
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,989
<font color="#ffffff"> there a guitar over there, and it  sounds like a guitar. I find it a</font>

367
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> bit odd. So, there are no saxophones  on the record. No saxophones.</font>

368
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Liam, you and Twitter...  Why do you stay on Twitter?</font>

369
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I like winding people up, man.  Without a doubt, man.</font>

370
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You really do.  Without a doubt.</font>

371
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> That's what it's about.  Know what I mean?</font>

372
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Everyone's a bit square  at the moment, aren't they?</font>

373
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Everyone is a little bit  serious and miserable.</font>

374
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Know what I mean?  I do like winding people up.</font>

375
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And I can take it, I do  like a wind-up back.</font>

376
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> But it's a bit...  A lot of these rock and roll stars</font>

377
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,989
<font color="#ffffff"> these days are coming  and just getting the cheque.</font>

378
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Imagine Keith Moon drumming his arse  off and then going home.</font>

379
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> You boot a few things  and that, don't you?</font>

380
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Know what I mean?  And the tweets...</font>

381
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Some of them are a little bit out  of order and I do apologise.</font>

382
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,989
<font color="#ffffff"> But...  You know?</font>

383
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,989
<font color="#ffffff"> A bit?  There was a time recently</font>

384
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> when you were hacked.  It's still going on, that.</font>

385
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> There's a police investigation.  But previously...</font>

386
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> LAUGHTER.  You had tweeted Noel.</font>

387
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And I remember, how real is that?  Is that a game?</font>

388
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,989
<font color="#ffffff"> And then you slap each other  on Twitter and then you phone each</font>

389
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,989
<font color="#ffffff"> other up and have a laugh?  No.</font>

390
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,989
<font color="#ffffff"> That's well for real, man.  Is it really?</font>

391
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,989
<font color="#ffffff"> We don't like each other, man.  A lot of people think we're waiting</font>

392
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,989
<font color="#ffffff"> around for a few more noughts  on the end but they've already</font>

393
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> offered us loads of money.  Like millions and millions.</font>

394
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> It's not about the money, is it?  Know what I mean?</font>

395
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Yeah.  The age gap is five years. When your</font>

396
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,989
<font color="#ffffff"> kids, five years is a big age gap.  It started off come he bought a</font>

397
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,989
<font color="#ffffff"> stereo once, he was working and I  had my first drink and I got up in</font>

398
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the middle of the night and he had  his sound system. I was looking for</font>

399
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the lights, my head was spinning and  I thought, I can't find the lights,</font>

400
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and I thought fuck it, and I'll piss  here and I tempt WWE all over his</font>

401
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,989
<font color="#ffffff"> set. That's where it started -- and  I pissed all over his set. I said,</font>

402
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> it could have been worse, it could  have been in your mouth. Got away</font>

403
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> lightly, I think.  Me and Liam have squared away.</font>

404
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Only for ten minutes.  Because you threw my</font>

405
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,989
<font color="#ffffff"> hat across a bar.  No, you started it.</font>

406
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> He got excited.  Did Liam piss in your hat, Idris?</font>

407
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> He gave a feel of my hair.  No, I didn't.</font>

408
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I gave him a hug.  He didn't like that</font>

409
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,989
<font color="#ffffff"> because he loves his hair.  And then he took my hat off.</font>

410
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,989
<font color="#ffffff"> So we had a little bit of...  But we're all good, now.</font>

411
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Great!  We'll leave it there!</font>

412
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Thank you so much, Liam Gallagher.  Good luck with the record and the</font>

413
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,989
<font color="#ffffff"> tour. The, stay. -- Liam. We're  still on the telly! We've got to go</font>

414
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,989
<font color="#ffffff"> to the weather and the local news  now.</font>

415
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Right, that's nearly it,  but before we go, just time</font>

416
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,989
<font color="#ffffff"> for a visit to the big red chair.  Who is there? What's your name?</font>

417
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Rosamond. Where are you from? New  Zealand. Oh, New Zealand. Do you</font>

418
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,989
<font color="#ffffff"> live here? Yes, just moved here.  What are you going to do? I work in</font>

419
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,989
<font color="#ffffff"> recruitment and HR. Goodness, that's  quite dull! A couple of years ago</font>

420
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,989
<font color="#ffffff"> when I was at university with my  boyfriend he was doing a paper where</font>

421
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,989
<font color="#ffffff"> he had to wear a heart monitor for  the weekend. He stayed in and I went</font>

422
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:32,989
<font color="#ffffff"> out, I came home at 4am, as you do,  I woke him up... We knew where that</font>

423
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> was going, didn't we? He'd been  shagging someone else because the</font>

424
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,989
<font color="#ffffff"> heart monitor would have gone up.  No, Liam, no. Its choices and</font>

425
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> consequences. You chose to flip her,  and now look. We're dying to hear</font>

426
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:05,989
<font color="#ffffff"> the rest of her story. Can I go now?  No, said! -- sit. Who is next?</font>

427
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:17,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Hello. No, it's too late, that was  Chris Rock! Concentrate, everybody.</font>

428
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,989
<font color="#ffffff"> Hello. What's your name? Surely.  What do you do? I'm a beauty</font>

429
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,989
<font color="#ffffff"> therapist. In London? Yes. Lovely.  I'm from Malaysian. How long have</font>

430
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,989
<font color="#ffffff"> you been here? 20 years. You must be  good at beauty therapy? I'm all</font>

431
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,989
<font color="#ffffff"> right. A ringing endorsement! On you  go. OK, I went to a yoga class one</font>

432
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,989
<font color="#ffffff"> day with my new sports bra top,  which is a light blue colour. I'm</font>

433
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,989
<font color="#ffffff"> feeling good about myself, 20  minutes later I go into the class</font>

434
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,989
<font color="#ffffff"> and I look at the reflection and the  top has turned into deep blue</font>

435
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,989
<font color="#ffffff"> instead of light blue in a  particular area, on the nipples,</font>

436
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,989
<font color="#ffffff"> which is when I realised that they  don't have any glands and there is</font>

437
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,989
<font color="#ffffff"> no sweat. I've panicked, I started  rubbing it hopefully to blend in the</font>

438
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,989
<font color="#ffffff"> sweat but it actually got worse, so  the nipple turned hard. LAUGHTER</font>

439
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,989
<font color="#ffffff"> I had two direct nipples. That was  the longest yoga class ever! We love</font>

440
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:35,989
<font color="#ffffff"> her even more!  Well done, everyone.</font>

<font color="#ffffff"> If you'd like to join us on the show  and have a go in the red chair,</font>

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
White Collar - Season 01 - Episode 01

2
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,590
How are you doing?

3
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,620
- I'm good,  how are you doing?
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,180
Only 5 bucks, man.

5
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,800
I'll give you $3.

6
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Sir!

7
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,090
Take good care of her.
I'll be back in a month.

8
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,400
Thank you, sir.

9
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,920
Drop. Three.

10
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,350
Drop. Two.

11
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,650
Drop. Four. All pins down.

12
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,470
Preparing to open.

13
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,949
Three, two, four... Wait!

14
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,010
What happened?

15
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,240
I said wait. You didn't wait.

16
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,220
10, 000 man-hours to get this close to
the Dutchman, and you blow up my evidence.

17
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,150
Agent Burke, how did you
know it was gonna do that?

18
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,810
Three, two, four.
Give me your phones.

19
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,900
What's it spell?

20
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,860
- FBI.
- Yeah... FBI.

21
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,250
Apparently, he knew we were coming.

22
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,150
You think so, Copernicus?

23
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,780
Somebody want to tell me
what this is? Huh? Anybody?

24
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,920
Nobody knows what it is? Great.

25
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,230
Look at you.

26
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,460
How many of you went to Harvard?

27
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,250
Don't raise your hands. Don't.

28
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,540
Ah, Diana. Look at this.

29
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,980
Apparently, our boy has a sense of humor.

30
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,930
What?

31
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,510
Neal Caffrey escaped.

32
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,600
What's this?

33
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,560
US Marshals are requesting your help.

34
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,920
- My help?
- Director Thompson asked for you personally.

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,350
Me? Why would he want me?

36
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,190
Probably because you're the
only one who ever caught him.

37
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,660
Agent Burke.

38
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,110
I'm Thompson, US Marshals.

39
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,992
Appreciate the help.
You were the case agent.

40
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:39,690
Yes, I was.

41
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,900
So you'll agree that this
is an unusual situation.

42
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,550
Why would Neal run with three
months left on a four-year sentence?

43
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
That's what we're wondering.

44
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,520
This is Warden Haskley.

45
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,990
Agent Burke, FBI.

46
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,860
You're the guy who dropped the ball.

47
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,980
You, of all people, should know
what Neal Caffrey's capable of.

48
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,220
I know I spent three years
of my life chasing him

49
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,920
and you let him walk
out the front door.

50
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,980
Gentlemen, might I remind you that
Caffrey has a four-hour head start?

51
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,300
Caffrey came out of the e-block
staff bathroom dressed as a guard.

52
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,850
- Where'd he get the uniform?
- Uniform supply company on the internet.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,990
He used a credit card?

54
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,580
He used my wife's American Express.

55
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,460
We're tracing the number
in case he uses it again.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,800
He won't.

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
Hey, pretty boy!

58
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,590
How did he get the
key cards for the gate?

59
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,490
We think he restriped a utility
card, using the record head on that.

60
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,590
You should have given him a CD player.

61
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,020
He walked out the front door, hot-wired
a maintenance truck in the parking lot.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,290
We found it abandoned near the airport.

63
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,330
We beefed up security just in
case he tries to get out that way.

64
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,250
We're not gonna catch Caffrey
using roadblocks and wanted posters.

65
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,970
He shaved his beard
just before he escaped.

66
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,570
Neal doesn't have a beard.

67
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,780
The inmates are photographed each
morning as they exit their cells.

68
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,320
I hardly recognize him.

69
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,370
I think that's the point.

70
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,890
- This morning?
- Yes.

71
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,740
Run the series back.

72
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,430
Stop.

73
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,420
That's it... when he stopped shaving.

74
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,160
I want to know everything
that happened that day.

75
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,730
He had a visitor.

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,550
Kate Moreau. Know her?

77
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,110
Yeah. I do.

78
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,900
- No audio?
- No.

79
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,510
She comes back every week like clockwork.

80
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,930
She's not thrilled about this visit.

81
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,410
How soon can we get a
lip-reader in here?

82
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,850
I'll save you the trouble.

83
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,750
"Adios, Neal. It's been real."
Did she come back next week?

84
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,190
She never came back.

85
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,430
Okay. Let's find Kate.

86
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,650
I see Kate moved out.

87
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,830
She leave you a message in that?

88
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,800
The bottle is the message.

89
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,550
It's been a while.

90
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,270
Yeah.

91
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,980
A few years, give or take.

92
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,280
You carrying?

93
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,060
You know I don't like guns.

94
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,990
They ask me, what makes a guy like you

95
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,720
pull a boneheaded escape
with four months to go?

96
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,360
I guess you figured it out.

97
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,520
Kate says "adios" to you at prison,
then gets busy with her disappearing act.

98
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,320
Her trail ends here.

99
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,540
But you already know that.

100
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,630
I missed her by two days.

101
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,670
Still... It only took you a month
and a half to escape a supermax.

102
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,590
Damn impressive.

103
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,430
- All clear. Subject identified and unarmed.
- Roger that.

104
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,400
Are we surrounded? How many?

105
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,770
Including my agents and the marshals?

106
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,030
All of them, I think.

107
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,690
What's the message?

108
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Goodbye.

109
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,520
Women.

110
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,310
They're gonna give you another
four years for this, you know.

111
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't care.

112
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,120
That's the same suit you were wearing
the last time you arrested me.

113
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,310
Classics never go out of style.

114
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,290
You know what this is?

115
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,450
No idea.

116
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,128
I got it from a case
I was supposed to be working on

117
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,540
before they yanked me off to find you.

118
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,570
You think you'll catch him?

119
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,660
Don't know.

120
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,760
He's good.

121
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,030
Maybe as good as you.

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,570
What's it worth if
I tell you what this is?

123
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,630
- Is it worth a meeting?
- What are you talking about?

124
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,524
If I tell you what this is right now,

125
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,180
will you agree to meet me
back in prison in one week?

126
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,120
- Just a meeting.
- Okay.

127
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,640
It's a security fiber for
the new Canadian $100 bill.

128
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,500
Put your hands where I can see them.

129
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,440
- Let's go.
- One week.

130
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,190
Got him.

131
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,190
What's got the belt-and-suspender
boys all riled up?

132
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,270
- You.
- Me? What'd I do?

133
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,560
Caffrey was right.

134
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,770
That stuff from the bank vault...
Security fibers for the new Canadian 100.

135
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,252
I'll be damned.

136
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,580
Apparently, the formulation
is still classified.

137
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,140
The Canadian secret service is very
curious to know how you figured it out.

138
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,396
This should be fun.

139
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,370
You may have started
an international incident.

140
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,980
How did you know?
Come on, Peter.

141
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,690
It's what I do.

142
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,770
How upset were the Canadians?

143
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
Oh, very.

144
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,530
Well, as upset as Canadians can get.

145
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,604
All right, so, I agreed to a meeting.

146
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:26,740
We're meeting.

147
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,930
I know why you call him "The Dutchman".

148
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,490
Like the ghost ship, he disappears
whenever you get close.

149
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,360
How do you know anything about him?

150
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,720
You know my life.
You don't think I know yours?

151
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,090
- Did you get the birthday cards?
- Nice touch.

152
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,500
You've been after the Dutchman
almost as long as you were after me.

153
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,820
I'll help you catch him.

154
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,440
Really? Really?
How... how does that work?

155
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,750
You want to be prison pen pals?

156
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,890
You can get me out of here.

157
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,930
There's case law, precedent.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
I can be released into your custody.

159
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,970
Nice. This is... this is very nice.

160
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,630
But you're right... I do know you.

161
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,960
And I know the second you're out,
you'll take off after Kate.

162
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,380
Peter... I am not gonna run.

163
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,430
GPS tracking anklet.

164
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,880
The new ones are tamper-proof,
never been skipped on.

165
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,150
There's always a first time.

166
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,460
Think about it.

167
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,470
Sorry, Neal.

168
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:28,940
Nice try.

169
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,500
Lights out, Bobby. Shut 'em down.

170
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,900
Neal, you got to turn that off.

171
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,770
Get one more minute, Bobby?

172
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,640
Okay, one more minute.

173
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,030
Is it midnight yet?

174
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,020
Yeah, it's midnight.

175
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,410
Shut up, bitch!

176
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,190
You coming to bed tonight?

177
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,810
Yeah.

178
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,270
What's wrong?

179
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,050
Nothing.

180
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,130
Oh, don't tell me it's Neal Caffrey.

181
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,440
I've been competing
with him for three years.

182
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,030
He'd be out today.

183
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,230
You considering his offer?

184
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,610
Of course you are,
or you'd be in bed with me.

185
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,380
Can he help you find him?

186
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,200
Neal's smart.

187
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,050
You know how much I like smart.

188
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,780
Is he as smart as those Ivy League
co-eds they throw at you?

189
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,460
He's almost as brilliant as
the woman I married.

190
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,530
Ooh, good answer.

191
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,440
So, what's the problem?

192
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,070
This is not the way it's supposed to go.

193
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,370
You get caught, you do your time.

194
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,920
There's more to this... more
to this than some lost love.

195
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,470
Some side angle he's playing.

196
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,730
So you're suggesting he escapes
a maximum-security prison,

197
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,733
knowing full well that you'd catch him,

198
00:15:57,734 --> 00:16:01,640
just so he could trick you
into letting him out again?

199
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,920
- It's a working theory.
- Yeah. Keep working.

200
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,620
Is it so hard for you to believe a man
would do that for the woman he loves?

201
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,380
Neal just bought himself four
more years in prison. For what?

202
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,370
For what?

203
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,090
If you were Neal,
you wouldn't have run for me?

204
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,860
Let me see it.

205
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,230
You understand how this works?

206
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,040
Yeah, I'm being released into the custody
of the FBI under your supervision.

207
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,620
I let this thing chafe my leg.
Anything I'm missing?

208
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,290
Yeah. If you run and I catch you,

209
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,140
which you know I will because I'm 2-0,
you're not back here for four years.

210
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,490
You're back here for good.

211
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,510
You're gonna be tempted
to look for Kate. Don't.

212
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,120
I told you... The bottle
meant "goodbye".

213
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,530
Then leave it at that.

214
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,530
This is a temporary situation.

215
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,960
Help me catch the Dutchman,
we can make it permanent.

216
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,870
Where are we headed?

217
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,560
Your new home.

218
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,480
This is Neal Caffrey.
My office called earlier.

219
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,350
There you go... "snake eyes".

220
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,290
Thank you.

221
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,920
Can I talk to you for a second?

222
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Hang on. A little farther down.

223
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,840
Do I have to stay here?

224
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,450
Cowboy up, all right?

225
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,980
It cost $700 a month to house you on
the inside, so that's what it costs here.

226
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,460
For the money,
this is as good as it gets.

227
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,900
You find something better, take it.

228
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,910
What about clothes?
I'm wearing my entire wardrobe.

229
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,270
You like thrift stores.

230
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,140
There's one at the end of the block.

231
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,853
No, don't start. No protests.

232
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,980
This is what you wanted, isn't it? Huh?

233
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,810
Look at it.
It's no... oh look at her.

234
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,540
You don't get that in prison,
do you? No, not at all.

235
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,401
Listen, your tracking
anklet is set up so that

236
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:05,170
you can go anywhere
within 2 miles of this place.

237
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,910
Here's your homework.

238
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,020
Remember... Two miles.

239
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,400
I'll see you at 7:00 a.m.

240
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,880
I've come to donate these.

241
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,990
Men's suits.

242
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,840
Those are fantastic.

243
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,540
They belonged to my
late husband... Byron.

244
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,880
He really did have
great taste in clothes.

245
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,190
May I? Thank you.

246
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,080
This is a Devore.

247
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Yes. He won it from Sy himself.

248
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,850
- Won it?
- He beat him at a backdoor draw.

249
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,590
Your husband played
poker with Sy Devore?

250
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,590
He certainly did. And so did I.

251
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,920
- No.
- Yes.

252
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,780
The guys would even let me
sit in once in a while on a hand.

253
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,840
And I was good.

254
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,000
I' m glad to see you appreciate these.

255
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,150
I was hoping someone would.

256
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
I've got a whole closet full of them.

257
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,240
A whole closet?

258
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,826
Well, actually, it's
a guest room, but, uh,

259
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:28,200
but I haven't used it for
anything except storage for years.

260
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,040
Byron used to wear that one
whenever we went dancing.

261
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,990
The neighborhood was...
Let's say it was much nicer then.

262
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,020
You live nearby?

263
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,820
Not far.

264
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm here for Caffrey, room 11.

265
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

266
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,050
"Snake eyes".

267
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,610
Nice guy.

268
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,270
Left you a note.

269
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,350
You've got to be kidding me.

270
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,810
Good day.

271
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,810
Thank you.

272
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,590
I think I have the wrong address.

273
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,360
You must be Peter.

274
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,730
I'm looking for Neal Caffrey.

275
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,720
He's upstairs.

276
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,820
- You're early.
- We're shagging a lead at the airport.

277
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,650
We got a hit on "Snow White".

278
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,270
"Snow White".

279
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,980
The phrase you decoded from a suspected
Dutchman communiqué to Barcelona.

280
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,670
You moved.

281
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,060
Yeah. It's nicer than the
other place, don't you think?

282
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,030
Yeah. I don't remember the
other place having a view.

283
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,490
I went to the thrift store,
like you suggested.

284
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,320
- And June...
- Lady with the dog. We met.

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,320
...was donating her
late husband's clothes.

286
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,890
We hit it off.
She had an extra guest room.

287
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,660
You said if I found a nicer place
for the same price, I should take it.

288
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,930
I did say that.

289
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,360
All this for $700?

290
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,990
Yep. But I help out around the place.

291
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,490
Oh, sure. Feed the dog.

292
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,260
Yeah. Wash the jag.

293
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,050
Watch her granddaughter
from time to time.

294
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,090
She's got you babysitting?

295
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,830
How's it going?

296
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,650
Morning, Neal.

297
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,190
- Granddaughter?
- She's an art student.

298
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,930
Unbelievable.

299
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,320
Go get dressed.

300
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,410
You mind?

301
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,090
Hey, grandma.

302
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,750
Good morning, Cindy.

303
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,630
It's perfect.

304
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,930
Even the freakin' coffee is perfect.

305
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,090
That's not jewelry on
his ankle, you know.

306
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,600
He's a felon.

307
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,050
So was Byron.

308
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,960
You look like a cartoon.

309
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,610
This is classic rat pack.
This is a Devore.

310
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,900
Sorry, Dino.

311
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,220
Will you stop with the hat?

312
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,080
Come on. Let's go.

313
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,520
You're upset.

314
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,320
- Sour grapes.
- What was that?

315
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,195
Look, you tell me which rule I broke,

316
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,210
and I will thumb it
back to prison myself.

317
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,430
For starters...

318
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,310
I work hard. I do my job well.

319
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,389
And I don't have a
$10 million view of Manhattan

320
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,340
that I share with a 22-year-old
art student while we sip espresso.

321
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,700
Why not?

322
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,950
Why not?

323
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,920
Because I'm not supposed to.

324
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,360
The amount of work I do equals
certain things in the real world.

325
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,910
Not cappuccino in the clouds.

326
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,180
Look, I will find out where June buys
her coffee if it's that important to you.

327
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,930
- It's not about the coffee.
- I think it is.

328
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,690
No, it's not.

329
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,970
This is what gets you into trouble.

330
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,205
This is the start of those
something-for-nothing schemes

331
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,370
that lead to the frauds
that got you locked up.

332
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,380
I think it's some sort of Italian roast.

333
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,670
Get in the car.

334
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,520
- Okay. Who's that?
- That's Diana.

335
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,170
Diana is my probie.

336
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,630
- Probie?
- Probationary agent.

337
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,000
She does everything I don't.

338
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,100
She's very good at her job,
and she can do way better than you.

339
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,130
You must be Neal Caffrey.

340
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,850
Nice hat.

341
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,730
- What have we got?
- His name's Tony Field.

342
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,220
Customs flagged him coming in from
spain in response to our "Snow White" bolo.

343
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,440
Customs playing nice?

344
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,460
The usual chest-pounding...
He's in their custody, not ours.

345
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,960
Less paperwork for me.
What's he carrying?

346
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,880
Oh, you're gonna love this.

347
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,770
"Blanca Nieves y los siete enanos"?

348
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,780
"Snow White and her seven little men."

349
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,370
This is what triggered our alert?

350
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,060
What do we know about this guy?

351
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,640
Says he's a rare-book dealer.

352
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,250
Anything wrong with his paperwork?

353
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,530
No. He brought in the same books in the
same quantity on three previous trips.

354
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,620
He declared them each time.

355
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,310
All right, Dino. Are we wasting our time?

356
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,440
They're not limited runs or special editions.
Can't be worth much.

357
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,420
So why go to all the trouble
of flying them in?

358
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,227
Good question.

359
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,770
He sure is nervous for
having all the right paperwork.

360
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,190
- I want to talk to him.
- I'll set it up.

361
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,230
Hey, boss, I'm grabbing some coffee.
You want some?

362
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,120
Yeah. Anything but decaf.

363
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,060
Diana, I'll take mine straight.

364
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,110
Neal, the coffee shop's outside.

365
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,660
You are way out of your league.

366
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,730
Oh, harmless flirting. It's like a dance.

367
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,570
Ah, there is no dance.

368
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,270
You're not even on her dance card.

369
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,290
No dancing for you.

370
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,790
Um, she digs the hat.

371
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,560
Um, she'd rather be wearing the hat.

372
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,170
Peter Burke, FBI.

373
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,670
FBI?

374
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,450
Oh, they're really kicking it up a notch.

375
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,000
So, you're a book dealer.

376
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,180
Yes. Well, as I have told everyone here,

377
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,400
repeatedly, my business is the
import and sale of rare books.

378
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,890
How rare can they be?
You've got 600 of them.

379
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,360
Would you like me to go to the crime lab?

380
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,210
Help you dust for fingerprints?

381
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,140
I get it. 'Cause I'm telling
you how to do your job.

382
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,650
So, "Snow White"... in Spanish?

383
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,710
"Snow White" was not
created by Disney, detective.

384
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,930
There are a few stories that
predate "Steamboat Willie".

385
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,420
I'm a federal agent.

386
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,050
And you mean folklore of
the virginally pure queen?

387
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,020
Like Alexander Pushkin's "Tale of the
White Princess and the Seven Knights"?

388
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,010
Is that what you mean?

389
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,370
What are the books for?

390
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,740
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't talk to my client.

391
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,150
Constitution and all.

392
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,370
Were you chasing the ambulance,
or did they give you a ride?

393
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,870
Huh? You must have thumbed it.

394
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,700
No dance, huh?

395
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,060
Not for you.

396
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,080
I thought the FBI had a policy.

397
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,080
That's the military.
We don't ask. We don't care.

398
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,400
Where's the customs inspector?

399
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,770
Neal was right.
The books aren't worth much.

400
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,420
You could pick them up for
a few dollars on eBay.

401
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,000
Hey, why didn't you tell me
the guy lawyered up?

402
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,210
The second he makes that call,
I can't talk to him.

403
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,980
He didn't call anybody.

404
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,000
Then how did his lawyer know that...

405
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,060
I need paramedics in here now!

406
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,870
Nobody frisked the lawyer?!

407
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,120
God!

408
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,426
We've got a dead book dealer,

409
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:53,720
a killer lawyer, and a
bunch of worthless books.

410
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,740
All right. Come on.

411
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,180
As a reformed professional counterfeiter,
what is the Dutchman's interest in these?

412
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,820
Published 1944 in Madrid.

413
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,250
This is what he's after.

414
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,160
The top sheet?

415
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,320
More than that. This is a piece of
1944 Spanish Press Parchment.

416
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,560
- That's what he wanted.
- Good. This is good.

417
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,820
He's gonna counterfeit something that
was originally printed on paper like that?

418
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,660
That's what I would do.

419
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,630
Tony made three
prior shipments with these.

420
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,570
Two blank pages per bookis 600 sheets.

421
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,580
Too many for paintings,
not enough for currency.

422
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,970
I bet our deadbook dealer knew.

423
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Diana, where's that wallet?

424
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,900
It's right here.

425
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,240
This is where he went the
day before he left Spain.

426
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,480
Yeah, I do remember him.

427
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,030
He came by several months ago
and then again last week.

428
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,470
This is what he came to see.

429
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,720
The Spanish Victory Bond.

430
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,810
He took several photographs of it.

431
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,530
Said he was gonna write a book.
It's a shame he's dead.

432
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,190
This Bond does have a
fascinating history.

433
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,450
It's a Goya.

434
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Yes. Beautiful, isn't it?

435
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,070
Oh, look at that.

436
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,630
A perfect fit.

437
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,730
You're starting to earn
your $700 a month.

438
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,830
You said it had a fascinating history.

439
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,380
Quite. It was issued during the war.

440
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,580
- 1944.
- Yes.

441
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,223
Yeah, the U.S. Issued it to support

442
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:37,450
the Spanish Underground in
their battle against the axis.

443
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,390
Very few have ever been redeemed.

444
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,748
There's speculation that
entire boxes were captured

445
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,580
and many of them are still
hidden away in the caves of Altamira.

446
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,870
Whole boxes of these?

447
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,100
Yeah.

448
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Boy, that would be something, wouldn't it?

449
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,330
This is the only surviving copy.

450
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,910
Except it's a forgery.

451
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,390
No. That's not possible.

452
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,340
What are you talking about?

453
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,065
It's the ink. This is iron-gal dye
mixed to match period colors,

454
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,030
but it hasn't dried yet.

455
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,450
You can still smell the gum arabic.

456
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,300
Uh, no. This has been here since 1952.

457
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,520
It's been here less than a week.

458
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,340
Okay. Tony makes two trips.

459
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,610
The first time,
he takes a picture of the Bond.

460
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:29,210
His second trip in, he steals the original
and replaces it with this copy.

461
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,600
Can we confirm that?

462
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,946
The timed ink-identification test puts the
age of the Bond at approximately six days,

463
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:36,590
which coincides with Tony's visit.

464
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,370
We're pulling surveillance
video to back it up.

465
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,410
Good. So the question is, why go to the
trouble of making a really nice forgery,

466
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,890
on the right kind of paper,
just to stick it back in the archives?

467
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,330
Is the Bond still negotiable?

468
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,710
It's a zero option,
so it never expires.

469
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,990
- What's it worth?
- $1,000 face value.

470
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,430
Drawing 9% interest.

471
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,620
Compounded for 64 years.

472
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,700
$248,000.

473
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
What he said.

474
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,230
Quarter of a million. Not chump change.

475
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,600
And he's got 600 sheets of the stuff.

476
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,380
$150 million... Give or take.

477
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,070
He'd be a rich man if
he could pass them off.

478
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,710
But it still doesn't tell us why he would
take out the real Bond and put in a forgery.

479
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,890
I think it does.

480
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,370
What if he claimed he found
boxes of the original bonds?

481
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,400
Dragged them out of those caves in Spain.

482
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,710
Yeah. How would they be authenticated?

483
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,910
They'd be taken to the archives
and compared to the original.

484
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,070
Which he's already switched
out with one of his own copies.

485
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,840
So of course they're gonna match.

486
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,900
Oh, this is good. This is really good.

487
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,510
All right. Let's think about this.

488
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,610
It's Elizabeth.

489
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,070
Would you believe me if I said I was pulling
upright in front of the house now?

490
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,920
You lost track of time. It happens.

491
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,380
I hope you didn't make dinner.

492
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,930
Did you forget who you married?

493
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,520
I am smarter than that.

494
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,310
So, how's Neal doing? Satchmo.

495
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,610
He met Diana.

496
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh, a woman who can resist his charms.

497
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,100
Bet that's taking some
getting used to. Is he helping?

498
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,200
We're onto something here, El.

499
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,780
So I won't wait up.

500
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,080
I'm leaving.
10 minutes. I promise.

501
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
20 at the most.

502
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,770
I know.

503
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,230
Bye.

504
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,130
Chew your food.

505
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,360
You sound like your father.

506
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,080
Big plans for the weekend?

507
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,510
Uh, you know, I got to fix the sink,
catch the game.

508
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,930
With Elizabeth?

509
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,150
Yeah. Yeah, she's into it.

510
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,480
How cool is that?

511
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,660
She likes to watch the Giants.

512
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,470
Even on your anniversary?

513
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,489
I see this stuff coming
from six months out,

514
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,610
and then I take it right
in the teeth every time.

515
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,490
Relax, man. You still have a few days.

516
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,610
No. This is what happened last year.

517
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,102
I said I'd make up for
it with something special,

518
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:20,690
not just a corner booth at Donatella's...

519
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,210
...and a rompin the sheets.

520
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,330
- Skip the dinner.
- We've been married a decade.

521
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,680
That doesn't cut it anymore.

522
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,340
Okay, Romeo, let's...
let's problem-solve.

523
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,370
What's she into?

524
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,480
Sexually?

525
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,610
No. No. Existentially.

526
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,070
What makes her feel alive?

527
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm drawing a blank.

528
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,710
How could you not know?

529
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,333
When you were chasing me,
you knew my shoe size,

530
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,410
what time I woke up in the morning.

531
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,560
- That's the job. Very different.
- So, a relationship isn't work?

532
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,140
Oh, no, no. You don't get to
lecture me on relationships.

533
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,260
My wife didn't change her identity and
flee the country to get away from me.

534
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,040
Yes, yes, yes.

535
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,720
That was harsh.
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

536
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, you did.
Did she really flee the country?

537
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,990
- I don't know.
- France? Did she go to France?

538
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,380
I don't know.

539
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,810
- What am I gonna do?
- No.

540
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,410
No more relationship advice
from this side of the car.

541
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,820
Call Dr. Phil, okay?

542
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,845
I saw the best mind of
my generation get run down

543
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:06,060
by the drunken taxicab
of absolute reality.

544
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,490
What the hell, Mozzie?

545
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,480
Sitting in the dark,
misquoting Ginsberg?

546
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,070
The light's how they find you, man.

547
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,480
Hey, you know,
you can't just help yourself here.

548
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,080
- How'd you get in?
- I used this.

549
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,040
I knocked.

550
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,220
I introduced myself to June. She's great.

551
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,720
Did you get a load of that granddaughter?

552
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,250
- Thanks for coming.
- What was I gonna do... not come?

553
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,000
Can I see?

554
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,190
Can you pick it?

555
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,870
No way. No way.

556
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,190
You flew too close to the Sun, my friend.

557
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,770
They burned your wings.

558
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,220
Where's Kate, Moz?

559
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,870
Where'd she go?

560
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,170
She's a ghost, man.

561
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,800
She did an outstanding
job of melting away.

562
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,290
Well, keep looking.

563
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,430
- Check France.
- France?

564
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,270
I know, okay? It's probably nothing.

565
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,590
Just... look everywhere.

566
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,230
There's something else.

567
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,970
I need you to help me
figure out who created... this.

568
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,890
It's superb.

569
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,080
You know the worst thing
about art forgery?

570
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,310
You can't take credit for your work.

571
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,330
El?

572
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,790
Honey?

573
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,750
What do you like?

574
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,410
What's special?

575
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,370
You haven't changed. I've changed.

576
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,080
Yeah? This is Burke.

577
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,800
It's Jones. Caffrey's anklet
activated. Is he with you?

578
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,950
No. I'm coming.

579
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,930
El, I've got to go.
Neal's outside his radius.

580
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,050
Agent Burke, are you still there?

581
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,630
Caffrey is with me.

582
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,840
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

583
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,610
Good morning, honey.

584
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,900
Peter.

585
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,830
- You're on my couch?
- Yeah, I came to talk to you.

586
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,270
And, uh, frankly, Peter, I have to say
I'm surprised you have such an amazing wife.

587
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,620
Yeah, I like her. Get off my couch.

588
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,310
- Honey, we're just chatting.
- Chatting?

589
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,560
How did you get here?

590
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,150
- Cab.
- You activated your tracker.

591
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,660
You're in my house
on my couch with my wife.

592
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,140
Oh, hey, Satchmo.

593
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,300
Now you're petting my dog.

594
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,930
Did you really put Elizabeth under
surveillance before you asked her out?

595
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,980
- Peter, I underestimated you.
- You told him?

596
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,560
He said he wanted to make sure
that I wasn't seeing anybody else.

597
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,750
Honey, I think it's cute.

598
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,140
- I think it's adorable.
- I'm putting you back in prison.

599
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,010
I know who the Dutchman is.

600
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,660
Enlighten me.

601
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,830
Curtis Hagen.

602
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,951
He's an art restorer...

603
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:26,650
one of the best in the world,
but his own work never took off.

604
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,940
He's particularly good
at Goya restorations.

605
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,230
That's what this is, Peter.
The Bond is him showing off.

606
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,480
- Interesting theory. How do you prove it?
- He signed it.

607
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,890
I think we might have noticed
a signature tucked in the corner.

608
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,580
Show him.

609
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,050
Look at the pants on the Spanish peasant.

610
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,980
What do you see?

611
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,620
It's the initials "C" and "H".

612
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,320
I don't know.
That's... that's a stretch.

613
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,940
This Bond is a masterpiece.

614
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,120
If I'd done something this good,
I would have signed it.

615
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,390
The forgeries you caught me on,
I signed them.

616
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,390
Where?

617
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,720
Look at the bank seal under
polarized light sometime.

618
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,790
Hagen is doing a church
restoration on third street.

619
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,780
We can stop by on our way in.

620
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,490
Fine.

621
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,530
Meet me in the car.

622
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,440
- I'm gonna say goodbye to my wife now.
- Yes.

623
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,470
It was nice to meet you.

624
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,050
Nice to meet you after all these years.

625
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,340
- This is it?
- Yep.

626
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,140
You can't come in.
We're closed for restoration.

627
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,730
Sorry, father.

628
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,850
Could we just... could we
just have a moment? Thank you.

629
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,360
Father...

630
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,000
Please, father. My best friend
is having a crisis of the soul.

631
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,220
He's a married man.

632
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,375
And he has the most devastatingly
beautiful assistant at work...

633
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:04,480
a very provocative woman.

634
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,530
He's been tempted.

635
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,000
More than tempted. I have details.

636
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,820
It's very common with men his age.

637
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,530
Unfortunately, very common.

638
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,030
And I... I want to confront him about
this before he tears apart his life.

639
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,870
He has a lot of faults.

640
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,570
I mean, don't get me started.
He is a mess.

641
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,580
But he's very spiritual.

642
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,630
I know this is the place where
my words will have the most effect.

643
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,750
This is the City of Churches.

644
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,420
We're closed.
Surely, there's another place.

645
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,540
This is where he was married.

646
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,080
- Five minutes.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you, father.

647
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,510
Sorry about that. We got five.

648
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,340
Did you just lie to a priest?

649
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,930
Do you think Diana's attractive?

650
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,970
- Sure.
- Then we're good.

651
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,310
- Extraordinary.
- Real nice.

652
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,630
So, if this Hagen...
guy is as good as you say...

653
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,390
How come I've never heard of him?

654
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,620
You only know the guys who get caught.

655
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,960
You know the second-best criminals.

656
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,820
What's that say about you?

657
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,180
It says there's an
exception to every rule.

658
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,180
Look... "C" and "H".

659
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,950
Where?

660
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,620
Right here.

661
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,520
Right there.

662
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,790
- "C" "H".
- Maybe.

663
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,670
What do you mean, maybe?
That's a "C" and an "H".

664
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,620
Can I help you, gentlemen?

665
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,890
Your face... it's familiar.

666
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:55,180
Maybe I've seen it on the news or
perhaps on a "most wanted" web page?

667
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,430
Neal Caffrey.

668
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,630
Forgive me if I don't shake
hands with an art thief.

669
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,200
I was never arrested for art theft.

670
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,750
Not arrested, but, as I recall,

671
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:08,230
you're known as quite
the renaissance criminal.

672
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,350
So you can understand my concern
at having you in my space.

673
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,860
And you are...?

674
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,180
Just a friend.

675
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,210
Well, friend... This church is closed.

676
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,990
- Did you see it?
- Okay, you've got me curious.

677
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,600
We'll check him out.

678
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,890
Listen to the spirit, son,
not the flesh.

679
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,770
I'll do that.

680
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,350
What's... that about?

681
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,140
Shut the door.

682
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,630
I need your help with this.

683
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,650
Is this the information on Hagen?

684
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,030
- No.
- Diana's on her way with that.

685
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,320
This is your wife's Visa bill.

686
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,662
Yeah. I got it all.

687
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,630
Her eBay bids, video rentals,
library books.

688
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,190
Thank you, patriot act.

689
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,920
So you're stalking your own wife?

690
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,700
Want to compare notes?

691
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,500
Touch?

692
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,840
You figure out what she likes?

693
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,430
Yep.It's all in the summary.

694
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,850
Pottery-making.

695
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,220
"Nancy Drew Mysteries".

696
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,610
Scented candles.

697
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,200
Oleander.

698
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,140
Old jazz.

699
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,350
Anything Italian, except anchovies.

700
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,410
Yeah, I don't think you're gonna find your
answer tucked into a list of her eBay bids.

701
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,290
Then help me out here,
all right? You're the romantic.

702
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,410
I mean, what's the deal with the bottle?

703
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,930
It's an '82 Bordeaux.

704
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,210
Yeah. Costs 800 bucks a pop.

705
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,850
It does when it's full. I got it empty.

706
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,490
Empty?

707
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,780
Look, when Kate and I met,
we had nothing.

708
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,620
I got that bottle,
and I used to fill it up with

709
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:58,400
whatever cheap wine we could afford.

710
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,195
And we'd sit in that crappy apartment
and drink it over cold pizza

711
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:03,890
and pretend we were
living in the Côte d'Azur.

712
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,050
How'd that work out for you?

713
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,810
It didn't.

714
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,540
'Cause that bottle was a
promise of a better life.

715
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,960
What Kate got was a guy
locked away for half a decade.

716
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,250
You make Elizabeth any promises, Peter?

717
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,730
Or do you think what she
really wants is oleander candles?

718
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,370
Hey, Diana. What do you got?

719
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,470
Hagen is leaving the country.

720
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,850
He booked a flight through a private
charter company in Barcelona for the 19th.

721
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,930
One week. Damn it, Neal.
Seeing you must have tipped him off.

722
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,010
He's going to Spain. That's something.

723
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,760
Is there any connection to our
books and the bonds or the murder?

724
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,240
Hagen's impressive as hell.

725
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,930
A lot of international holdings,
but he keeps himself out of the muck.

726
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,930
You get every available agent on this.

727
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,720
You know the good ones.
Steal them if you have to.

728
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,500
I want to know every
single thing about this guy,

729
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,230
and I don't want any excuses.

730
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,870
- Anything gets in your way...
- ...forge your signature.

731
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,460
- Always do.
- That's what I want to hear.

732
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,014
If you're right about Hagen,

733
00:45:05,015 --> 00:45:07,960
we have one week to
connect him to the Bond.

734
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:12,430
If we lose him on the 19th...

735
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,110
Neal, if we lose him, you're back in.

736
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,090
I can't save you.

737
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,690
- You're late.
- Hey, give me a break.

738
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,650
I'm a working man now.

739
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,860
So?

740
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,210
We were right about Hagen.

741
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,470
Of course we were right.

742
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:41,100
And I was stupid and impulsive,
and he saw me.

743
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,420
I have one week to link him to the bonds.

744
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,060
One week or what?

745
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,460
I go back.

746
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,770
No, no, no, no.

747
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,510
Yeah.

748
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,930
Did you find anything about Kate?

749
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,270
Apparently, if a tree falls in the forest,
it does make a sound.

750
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,000
I may lose her again, Moz.

751
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,500
Lose her? I just found her.

752
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,780
So did he.

753
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,240
So did he.

754
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,270
Remember when you told me
not to look for Kate?

755
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah.

756
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,880
Neal, you're putting me
in a tough spot here.

757
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,180
These were taken four days
ago at a San Diego ATM.

758
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,810
She's going under the name Kate Perdue.

759
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,320
You know what "perdue" means in French?

760
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,470
Yeah. It means "lost".

761
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,020
Yeah. Makes you wonder, right?

762
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,100
Is she lost to me or without me?

763
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,980
- Stop it.
- I just need a couple days, okay?

764
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,550
A... after this Dutchman thing is over.
A couple days to go to San Diego.

765
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,511
You could send an agent with me.
You can come with me.

766
00:46:53,512 --> 00:46:54,160
Stop it!

767
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,220
How many times are you gonna
screw up your life for this girl?

768
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,710
I hate to break it to you, buddy,
but she dumped you... with prejudice.

769
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,970
Exactly what is your
plan if you find her?

770
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,056
I know there's more to our story, okay?

771
00:47:15,057 --> 00:47:18,050
She disappears in the dust...
No, that's not an ending.

772
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,060
Come on, man.

773
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,620
We've all been there.

774
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,840
It gets easier.

775
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,130
Not if she's the one.

776
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,820
I brought this to you.
Doesn't that count for something?

777
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,320
No.

778
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,770
We made a deal.

779
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,440
I gave you something good here,
and you're about to blow it.

780
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,030
God.

781
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,600
You're right. You're right, Peter.

782
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,740
I'm a smart guy.

783
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,980
I should know when I've been dumped.

784
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
You figure out your
anniversary plans yet?

785
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,860
I'm getting close... very close.

786
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,790
So you got nothing?

787
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,060
Nothing. But I'll find it.

788
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,370
Hey, um... I'm gonna go
grab a smoke really quick.

789
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,610
Didn't know you smoked.

790
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,530
Ah, it's a nasty prison habit.
I've been trying to quit.

791
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,980
Jones, keep an eye on him.

792
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,150
Yeah.

793
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,280
Bum one from you?

794
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,620
These things will kill you.

795
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,100
That's what I keep hearing,
but I'm not dead yet.

796
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,160
But these filters... They're good.

797
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,520
Not for me, you understand.

798
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,800
I tear 'em off.

799
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,840
You need a light?

800
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,290
You should try the patch.

801
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,010
Two years and counting, my friend.

802
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,470
I hate the tan lines.

803
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,150
You don't smoke.

804
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,940
What was I supposed to do...
fire off a flare?

805
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,440
So, you tear off the filter?

806
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,420
Yeah. But I'm hard-core.

807
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,460
I found my bottle.

808
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,370
I found Hagen.

809
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,570
You first.

810
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,036
This is a warehouse down by the docks.

811
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:49,870
Hagen runs it through a shell
corporation out of Guatemala.

812
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,480
We didn't know about this. How did you?

813
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,000
I don't think you rely
on rumor as much as I do.

814
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,930
Let's go.

815
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,650
Do you hear that? You hear that?

816
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,500
- Hear what?
- Kind of rhythmic "ssh, ssh".

817
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,300
That's a press. Damn it, Peter.
That is a printing press.

818
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,340
He's printing the bonds in
there right now. You can hear it.

819
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,670
How long till they're done?

820
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,010
A multicolor print job as
complicated as the Goya...

821
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,380
test proofs, ink formulation,
perfect registration...

822
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,310
he'll be running it for days.

823
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,080
- Diana.
- Yeah, boss.

824
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,685
I need recording equipment
down here immediately.

825
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:38,270
You got it.

826
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,520
- Come on.
- I am on board.

827
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,900
Hagen is our guy.

828
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,540
But we still don't have
enough for a warrant.

829
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,140
We know the bonds are there.
Just open the door.

830
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,390
Yeah.

831
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,190
Well, you should read this... "Warrant law".

832
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,836
All I've got is sound
coming out of a warehouse

833
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:56,990
and no way to link him to the Bond.

834
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,400
- I've got to talk to your friend.
- Friend?

835
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,960
Come on, Neal.
The guy who gave you a cigarette.

836
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,210
- I have no...
- What... you think Jones is an idiot?

837
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:11,110
I have to know how he
connected Hagen to the warehouse.

838
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,870
Come on, Neal. And you got to trust me.

839
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,350
Okay. Okay.

840
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,690
I'll bring you to him...
first thing tomorrow.

841
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,890
Good.

842
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,760
Yeah?

843
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,540
Damn.

844
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,840
What's going on?

845
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,770
He ran.

846
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,210
What is this?

847
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,850
Hi, there.

848
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,950
What are you doing? You can't be here.

849
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,026
Oh, I... I'm taking a
photography class over at the Annex,

850
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:48,790
and pictures of rusty sheet
metal are a sure fire A.

851
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,880
Take him in.

852
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,040
Jimmy! Go get Hagen!

853
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,460
What exactly is going on here?!

854
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,670
Why'd you bring him inside?!

855
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,930
He was taking pictures.

856
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,380
Open the door! You're a dead man!

857
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,890
That sounds like inch-thick lexan.

858
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,540
Keys are on their way.

859
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,390
Nice.

860
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,720
You shouldn't have signed the bonds.

861
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,920
I'm no stranger to vanity myself,
so I understand the impulse.

862
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,390
I'm gonna kill you.

863
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,400
I hope whatever they're
giving you is worth it.

864
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,630
It is.

865
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,470
You are a particular kind of bastard!

866
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,680
Gentlemen, we have a
fugitive hiding in this building.

867
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,260
Knock down those doors.

868
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,860
Grab the bonds! Come on!
Let's go! Everybody, come on!

869
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,270
Quick! Let's go! Move it!

870
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,520
Come on! Let's go!

871
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,000
Get in there!

872
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,380
Do not move!

873
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,820
Get them up in the air!

874
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:35,930
This is what the law calls
an exigent circumstance.

875
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,780
Any of you Harvard grads
know what that is? Huh?

876
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,080
- No hands?
- Diana?

877
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,518
Exigent circumstance allows us
to pursue a suspect

878
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,850
onto private property
without obtaining a warrant.

879
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:50,290
And to seize any and all evidence
that has been discovered in plain view,

880
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,880
regardless of the connection
to the original crime.

881
00:54:55,870 --> 00:55:00,280
Remember me, friend?

882
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,930
Oh, there's your lawyer.

883
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,430
You know, you're really bad
at this escape thing.

884
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,450
What can I say?

885
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,120
- Cigar?
- Cuban?

886
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,560
You should arrest me.

887
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,280
I'll let the cigar go,
but you are a fleeing suspect.

888
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,480
Is that the original Victory Bond?

889
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,280
Why, yes.

890
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,420
Yes, it is.

891
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,310
You know, this makes me 3-0.

892
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,760
Maybe I'm not trying hard enough.

893
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,660
- Be careful.
- Okay.

894
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,190
- All right we're almost there..
- Honey...

895
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,020
I think I'm getting seasick.

896
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,060
Just a little farther.

897
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,230
- This is good.
- All right.

898
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,540
All right. Now, I want you
to keep your eyes closed.

899
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,230
I promise.

900
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,470
All right.

901
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,310
Okay. Open them.

902
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,680
Honey, you know how every year,

903
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,320
I'm always promising you
that we're gonna go...

904
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,230
...to the Caribbean.

905
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,930
This sort of what you wanted?

906
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,270
Well, I... I think if I keep my eyes closed,
I can actually imagine us being there.

907
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,840
- Ooh, and it's getting warmer.
- It is.

908
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,020
- Come here.
- Okay

909
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,710
Screw top.

910
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,100
Cheesy?

911
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,615
It's a little cheesy, but it's...

912
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,140
but it's sweet.

913
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,520
Maybe this will help.

914
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,440
- Belize.
- What?!

915
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,920
I found the time.

916
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,690
We have a week and two plane tickets
and a seized villain Sarteneja.

917
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,130
In... in where?

918
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,585
Oh, in this really
incredible beachfront villa

919
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:53,040
that the bureau seized
from this narco-trafficker.

920
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,380
- It's amazing.
- Okay. It's... enough.

921
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,220
Just... just tell me it's nice.

922
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,480
It's nice.

923
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,080
I love you.

924
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,410
I love you.

925
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,630
Thank you.

926
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,490
Thank you.

927
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,560
Do you think we can pull that
heater in a little closer?

928
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,600
Yeah. It's cold.

929
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,240
Yeah.

930
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,930
Can't beat that view.

931
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,370
Did Elizabeth like it?

932
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,590
She loved it.

933
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:42,870
Coffee?

934
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,850
- Yeah.
- Italian roast?

935
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,620
Going on vacation.

936
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,170
Yeah.

937
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,620
Yeah, we'll be back in a week.

938
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,160
Still wearing that suit.

939
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,490
Yeah. I love this suit.

940
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,220
Did they make a decision?

941
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,146
Figured if we didn't,

942
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,010
you'd end up making one
of these on your own.

943
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,387
I'm official.

944
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:19,740
You're a consultant,
and I own you for four years.

945
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,220
- You okay with that?
- Yeah.

946
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,960
You'll be here when I get back?

947
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,980
Where else am I gonna go?

1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,040
I hate this.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,480
Every year - every
year, it's like this.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,310
Finally squeezed into
a train at union square.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,450
Couldn't fall down if
you were shot. Come on.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,270
It's impossible to catch a cab.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,050
- Oh, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,760
- Yes.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,660
Enjoy your day.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,830
It's fashion week.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,590
- Peter... embrace it. Come on. .
- Yeah.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,980
There we go.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,900
Excellent. Good.

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,420
All right.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,660
Oh, no.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,460
Yes, all right.

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,480
Let me help you here.

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,090
Squeeze.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,420
We are supposed to be
interviewing our witness right now.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,250
Peter, all right. Relax.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,150
That's not gonna do it.

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,670
We're after an Israeli counterfeiter
- goes by the name of Ghovat.

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,650
We're going after "the ghost"?

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,000
We're going after the ghost.

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,300
What do you know about him?

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,910
I mean, this guy is nefarious.

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,360
I mean, counterfeit treasury bonds, dollars.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,160
He's rumored to be the first guy to
crack the micro printing on the Euro.

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,750
Well, now we can add murder to that list.

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,180
Are you sure he called himself Ghovat?

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,120
Yes.

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,160
Okay. What happened?

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,270
I was at the party.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Why were you there?

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,790
Many models were invited.

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,020
It happened as I was leaving,
when I went for my coat.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,030
I was in the back room when
the two men came in.

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,670
They were arguing.

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,900
They didn't see you?

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,260
I made sure to keep out of sight...
in the closet.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,860
They... started shouting at each other.

41
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,410
Then, suddenly, everything
went... very... quiet.

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,560
The man who called himself Ghovat
- I heard him leaving.

43
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,420
When I walk out, that's
when I saw the other man.

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,810
He was on the floor, already... dead.

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,270
Okay.

46
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,290
Our men are gonna stay with you for now.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,010
But if you need anything, day or
night, you feel free to call me.

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,080
If you heard this man again, do
you think you could identify him?

49
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,590
I will never forget his
voice as long as I live.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
White Collar - Season 01 - Episode 02

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,170
Have you I.D.'d the dead guy?

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,800
Foreign national out of
Turkey, known associate of Ghovat.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,620
Hmm, a falling-out over business.

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,260
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,790
My working theory
- this has something to do with fashion week.

56
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,440
Yeah, well, assuming our ghost has something
to sell, fashion week is a great cover.

57
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,240
He's got all his buyers in new York
this week, with no bells going off.

58
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,940
Unfortunately, we've got 30,000 buyers.

59
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,830
We've also got someone
who can identify his voice.

60
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,470
Are you gonna share?

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,710
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,620
It's never stopped you before.

63
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,390
- We throw a party.
- Is it your birthday?

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,940
- No.
- Then you're crazy.

65
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,750
Okay, look, okay?

66
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,410
Look at this.

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,990
Monte Carlo, Cannes, Ibiza, Rio -
this guy likes to have a good time.

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,210
- We put women, booze, fashion all together in
one spot - and what do we do, send him an E-vite?

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,570
He replies, "ghost plus one"?

70
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,670
No, we bring him to us.

71
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,900
We have Tara there
in the room, listening.

72
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,160
She can I.D. him.

73
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,830
- Got to party don't -
don't do this in the office.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,630
A party?

75
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,800
The witness is confident she
can identify him by his voice.

76
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,150
How do you know he'll show up?

77
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,910
We fill it with beautiful women.

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,430
I was addressing my case agent.

79
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,640
Looking at his M. O. , He
has a thing for models.

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,450
Yeah? Well, me too.

81
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,560
Hey, Jones! You like models?

82
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,020
- Love 'em.
- Jones likes 'em, too.

83
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,870
Is there a plan in here somewhere?

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,320
Call me when one shows up.

85
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,430
Look. Caffrey, Ghovat - these
guys are cut from the same cloth.

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,760
Neal's convinced that
our ghost will show up.

87
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,510
I say we trust his
instincts on this one.

88
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,720
We've never been this close to Ghovat.

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,900
I'll authorize 5 grand for this party.

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,040
God, you know, 15 would be better.

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,780
- We'll make 5 work.
- Yes.

92
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,440
- And we'll get Elizabeth to help us.
- My wife?

93
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,630
She's an event planner
-best in the business.

94
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,860
She'll work with us on the price?

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,340
- My wife?
- Your wife.

96
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,550
His wife.

97
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,480
- Don't hit me.
- I'm sorry.

98
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,650
Royal Ossetra caviar.

99
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,880
This is gonna be perfect.

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,590
<i>{\a6}***</i>

101
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,500
Neal, I just found spring bank.

102
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,010
Whiskey. Perfect.

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,010
I got a Garioch scotch over here.

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,540
'65?

105
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,320
No, '58.

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,370
Oh, grab the case.

107
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,640
All right, come on, we
got to itemize all this.

108
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,540
It's four bottles of scotch.

109
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,360
36 tins of Ossetra.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,950
- Booze and fish eggs. You got that?
- ya

111
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,280
Drop the watch, convict.

112
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,450
We're not on a shopping spree.

113
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,160
No, it wasn't for me. It was for you.

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,970
Oh, thank you, but there's
nothing wrong with my old watch.

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,060
Honey, actually, that looks great on you.

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,770
Ah, a little out of my price range.

117
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,500
There's nothing wrong with enjoying
the good things in life, Peter.

118
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,670
Then why do they always seem
to end up in here?

119
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,320
Okay, so, we've got the
alcohol and the food covered.

120
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,950
Now we just need the venue.

121
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,210
Don't worry.

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,100
I got that covered.

123
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,400
It's a loft.

124
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,340
Seized in a D. E. A. Bust.

125
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,170
1, 500 square feet, service
elevator - it's perfect.

126
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,770
Is that chalk outline?

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,470
I'm sure they've cleaned that up by now.

128
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,020
It has everything you need.

129
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,870
Yeah, if five drunk frat buddies show up.

130
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,280
Aren't you supposed to
be lining up super models?

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,830
Ah, 64 and counting.

132
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,940
Oh, Neal Caffrey throws a
party, and 64 super models show up.

133
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,420
Oh, no, sorry, my mistake. My
mistake. 65, actually.

134
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,410
These two are twins.

135
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,590
Is that another one of your super models?

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,070
No, it's just a friend.

137
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,580
He's got a place we can use.

138
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,710
You think your friend's
place is better than mine?

139
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,700
Okay, it's better than mine.

140
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,230
Yeah.

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,970
Okay.

142
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,370
It's a lot better than mine.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,300
Honey, I am really
impressed with this place.

144
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,030
I mean, I could have a
state dinner up here.

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,950
How did you pull that off?

146
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,240
He has a source.

147
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,020
But good luck trying to
pry it out of him.

148
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,940
Hmm, sounds like fun. I'll
work on him later.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,670
She'll work on you later.

150
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,950
Okay, guys, I got 20 minutes to
get fiber optics in play.

151
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,720
I want a camera on every single entrance
and exit, starting with that one right there.

152
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,190
Okay. Let's go.

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,280
Hello. You're definitely in
the right place.

154
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,040
You're also a little early.

155
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,910
And you must be Neal Caffrey.

156
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,550
I am.

157
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,930
Would you mind waiting
inside for a little bit?

158
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,020
Actually, I think I'm
exactly where I'm supposed to be.

159
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,670
Then let me escort
you downstairs, at least.

160
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,950
You know, I got to say, I
expected a little more.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,330
- I mean, you're charming enough, but...
- who invited you, again?

162
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,910
The agency.

163
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,780
I thought you were a model.

164
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,430
And I thought you were supposed to
be one of the smart ones.

165
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,530
Neal, this is agent Lauren Cruz.

166
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,590
I just had her transferred over.

167
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,120
She's gonna be keeping
an eye on you tonight.

168
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,050
So, where do you keep your gun?

169
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,500
All right.

170
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,930
Damn, Caffrey knows how to throw a party.

171
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,140
agent Burke.

172
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,560
- What?
- Hey, is that miss march?

173
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,660
Jones, pull it together.

174
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,520
Sports illustrated, not playboy.

175
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,780
Doing okay?

176
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,990
Come on.

177
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm with the most beautiful girl
here. I want to see her smile.

178
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,110
Neal, straight ahead. Red
shirt, dark jacket.

179
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,720
Seems pretty jumpy for a guy to
be at a party filled with models.

180
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,580
So, let's mingle.

181
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,720
Excuse me.

182
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,260
Hi, I saw you looking around. Can
I help you find someone?

183
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,000
- I know almost everybody here except for you, Mr. , Uh...
- Dmitri.

184
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,940
Dmitri.

185
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,700
Write down that
name -"Dmitri.

186
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,840
" I'm just admiring the view.

187
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,630
Yeah, beautiful crowd, right?

188
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,230
Quite stunning

189
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,110
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

190
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,470
Hello.

191
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,400
No dice, Peter. Not our voice.

192
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,870
All right.

193
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,380
Wait. He's speaking Hebrew.

194
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,050
What's he saying?

195
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,220
He's saying, "I'm waiting. Where are you? "

196
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,890
Ghovat is here. He's watching him.

197
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,070
Ghovat's here.

198
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,610
Peter, he's here. He's
watching Dmitri right now.

199
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,150
I got it.

200
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,350
Back me up. I need you to flirt.

201
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,450
What?

202
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,870
- You're charming enough, right?
- yeah

203
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,050
That guy right there.

204
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,990
I'll be right back. Stay here.

205
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,890
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,520
- You just look really familiar.
- sorry.

207
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,330
- Oh, yeah.
- Do I know you from somewhere?

208
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,590
***

209
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,310
We need to leave.

210
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,520
Come.

211
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,790
- How are you? Have you met?
- No.

212
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,470
Hello.

213
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,980
You know, my friend here, Isabella, was
noticing how fantastic your suit is.

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,330
We have to leave, unfortunately, but
it was lovely to see you.

215
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,180
Have a good night.

216
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,990
Ah, well, I'm a model.

217
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,460
Where do you work?

218
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,620
Um, actually, you know what, I think
you're right. I think I don't know you.

219
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,700
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,540
There he is.

221
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,400
I got it, I got it! Bower, Whitman,

222
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,390
move in! Move in. Repeat
- move in. Now, now, now!

223
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,190
Get off me!

224
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,650
This is madness!

225
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,810
No, it's
-it's not him.

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,720
Peter, we got the wrong guy!

227
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,760
You're not getting this thing off me?

228
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,070
I'm working on it. You're lucky.

229
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,300
They have you on a 2-mile tether.

230
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,220
That's a lot in new York.

231
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,950
Remember jimmy Dimako?

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,270
The feds had his anklet set at 22 feet.

233
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,490
He had to take a shower with
one foot out of the tub.

234
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,560
- That's not true.
- Okay, maybe 30 feet.

235
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,030
But you have it better.

236
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,000
2 miles isn't enough, Moz.

237
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,090
I need to find Kate.

238
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,120
The man with the ring was
with Kate in California.

239
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,250
You tell me what he wants from her.

240
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,340
'Cause he didn't find what
he was looking for in San Diego.

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,810
How do you know what he was looking for?

242
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,960
Because I told Kate I
kept everything -

243
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,940
the money, the bonds, the
art, all of it - in San Diego.

244
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,480
Well, clearly, that's not the truth, because
you told me it was all hidden in Portland.

245
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,880
Isn't it? Isn't it?

246
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Oh... there's nothing
hidden in either place, is there?

247
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,340
It's a test.

248
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,940
You told her San Diego.

249
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,290
You told me Portland.

250
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,580
Then whichever rock gets
overturned, you know who betrayed you.

251
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,250
Look, I just needed to
know what I already knew.

252
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,480
What, that you can trust me?

253
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,880
- Moz...
- that I'm the one who's been there through all of it?

254
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,100
But Kate - Kate's the
one who kicked over your rock.

255
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,930
Kate didn't betray me.

256
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,350
He forced her to.

257
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,330
Then why didn't Kate try to warn you when she
came to say goodbye to you that day in prison?

258
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,320
I think she might have, but
I was too stupid to see it.

259
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,970
Here.

260
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,650
"Weep for me, my love.

261
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll miss you more
-" what is this?

262
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,420
It's just an old love letter. It
doesn't mean anything, okay?

263
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,070
But... the FBI was closing in on us.

264
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,730
<i>{\a6}***</i>

265
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,150
We started taking precautions. We
started passing codes.

266
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,220
That could be cracked by anyone who's
ever seen the back of mad magazine.

267
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,780
Okay, you ask me why I don't tell you certain
things - it's that attitude right there.

268
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,340
I'm trying to be supportive.

269
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,590
Look, this was an early attempt.

270
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,860
Okay, we got more sophisticated as
the feds closed in.

271
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,880
So you think when Kate came to say goodbye
to you in prison, she left you a code?

272
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,150
Look, I need to see that security tape.

273
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,350
Your friend at the FBI has
access. He's seen it.

274
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,490
Oh, yeah, he's not just gonna hand it over.

275
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,080
You could... ask.

276
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,710
So, our ghost finally has a name.

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,540
It's Idil Hazeva.

278
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,870
Let's stick with "Ghovat"for now.

279
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,600
Do we know anything more about him?

280
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,110
Not much. No criminal record.

281
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,190
Name's not coming up on any of
our international watch lists.

282
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,010
We can't find him
registered anywhere in town.

283
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,260
Peter:Anything about the girl?

284
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,330
She's a model. We're looking at her.

285
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,580
What about Dmitri?

286
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,020
Andrei Dmitri, Uzbekistan national, linked
to a handful of enterprises -

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,130
uh, arms trading, money
laundering, prescription-drug fraud.

288
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,130
Exactly the kind of guy you'd
expect to show up at fashion week.

289
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,820
- Yeah.
- Does he still think he got away clean?

290
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,250
Uh, yeah. He slipped out the northwest
exit. Jones is sitting on him.

291
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,340
Tell Jones to keep his distance. I
don't want him getting tagged.

292
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,950
Let's see where this guy leads us.

293
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,180
Good work. We'll reconvene in an hour.

294
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,430
Nice report.

295
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,360
Thanks.

296
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,850
You know, you pull off the
whole FBI thing, too.

297
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,650
Yeah, no one looks good in FBI slacks.

298
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,430
Oh, don't sell yourself short.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,630
Better.

300
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,440
- You sure I wasn't a little too direct and...
- yeah, but I like where you're going with it.

301
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,030
Where we headed for lunch?

302
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,750
Oh, uh, I'm gonna have to take a pass.

303
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,540
Elizabeth wants to meet me in the park.

304
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,620
Picnic. That's romantic.

305
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,320
Yeah, should I be worried?

306
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,790
Did you do something wrong?

307
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,190
- Probably.
- Show no fear.

308
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,600
Maybe she's just gotten
used to spending time with you.

309
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,510
You think?

310
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,480
- I'm not the best person to ask.
- Yeah.

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,900
Hey, Peter, before you
go... I need a favor.

312
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah?

313
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,930
The last time Kate visited me in prison, before
she disappeared -you saw that security tape?

314
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,470
Yeah.

315
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,740
I'd like to see it.

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,240
You think that's a good idea?

317
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,300
It's the last time I saw her.

318
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,020
I just want some closure.

319
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,950
Help me wrap up this case, and I'll
see what I can do about that tape.

320
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,450
This is nice.

321
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
Right?

322
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,540
This is really nice.

323
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,330
Yeah, it's great.

324
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,750
Honey, relax. You're not in trouble.

325
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,830
Oh, thank god.

326
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,350
Why do you think I asked you to lunch?

327
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,130
I don't know. That was what scared me.

328
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,670
Okay, hold on.

329
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,880
I got you something.

330
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,280
You did?

331
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,190
- What...
- here.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,340
***

333
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,830
I noticed you were kind of looking at
that really nice watch at the warehouse.

334
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,540
It's not as nice, but it's close.

335
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,900
It's perfect.

336
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,270
- Yeah.
- Okay, try it on. Yes.

337
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,960
- Okay.
- Yeah.

338
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,640
- That's a different kind of...
- yeah, just...

339
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,740
- different kind of latch, there.
- Yeah, you go... There.

340
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,410
That's -
that's...

341
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,740
This is Burke. All
right, I'll be there at, uh...

342
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,330
I'll be therein five minutes. All right.

343
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,730
Look at that.

344
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,450
It works. It works.

345
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,410
- Looks good on you.
- Yeah.

346
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,620
What's going on?

347
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,380
They're moving me now.

348
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,630
What, protective custody?

349
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,940
No one's threatening you.

350
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,430
They're not taking any chances.

351
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,260
Came here to get an
agent, make contacts, not this.

352
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,640
Yeah. It's gonna be okay. All right?

353
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,500
If anybody can catch Ghovat, it's him.

354
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,980
Really?

355
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,960
He's the best.

356
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,580
Come here.

357
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,760
I just got word from Jones.

358
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,000
New watch.

359
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,010
Mm, yeah, gift from
Elizabeth. Thank you very much.

360
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,030
No sundial to clutter it up. Very nice.

361
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,150
What's Jones got?

362
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,930
- Dmitri is at a fashion show.
- Lucky him.

363
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,540
- And guess who's with him.
- Who?

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,680
Remember that model that
was with Ghovat last night?

365
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,350
However you got us
in, I don't want to know.

366
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,610
- That's our girl.
- That's our Dmitri.

367
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,890
Guy always looks like he's
waiting for something to happen.

368
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,870
Maybe he's waiting for Ghovat.

369
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,210
He lost his phone last night.

370
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,910
- If that was his only connection to him...
- figuring the only way back in is through the girl.

371
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,720
I'll buy that.

372
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,080
Want to go check it out?

373
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,780
No, I can't. I start flashing my
badge, they'll scatter like rats.

374
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,290
- You trust me?
- Nope.

375
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,870
Do you trust me to talk to Dmitri?

376
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,790
What are you thinking?

377
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,890
Stand there and look menacing.

378
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,090
- What?
- Stand there and look menacing.

379
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,640
No, Peter - "menacing" - you
look like your kid just struck out.

380
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,130
- What? This is menacing. What are you talking?
- No, it's not.

381
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,460
- It's menacing. It's menacing!
- That's not it.

382
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,400
Okay, that's it, right
there. Now cross your arms.

383
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,110
- What are you doing?
- I want to let him know you're packing.

384
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,380
Yeah.

385
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,800
Now say "I'll be back. "

386
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,520
No.

387
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,410
Yeah, Dmitri, right?

388
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,950
I never got your name.

389
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,150
No. You didn't.

390
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,790
What are you doing here?

391
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,430
Same thing you are.

392
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,510
Just waiting for a chance to
talk to our beautiful friend.

393
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,550
You enjoy the party?

394
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,800
A little too much
excitement for my taste.

395
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,360
Well, you know what they say.

396
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,170
It's not a party till
the police break it up.

397
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,620
Yeah, your little event may
have attracted the wrong element.

398
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,120
As a matter of fact, my phone was stolen.

399
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,930
That can make it tough to contact people.

400
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,540
But there are always ways to
get in touch with someone.

401
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,690
All right, let's cut the
act. We both know why we're here.

402
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,270
I don't know who you are, but
you're layout of your league.

403
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,080
This game takes way more than money.

404
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,340
You're not the only buyer
interested in what Ghovat is selling.

405
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm the only one that matters.

406
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,660
You and your friend should take a walk.

407
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,240
He is definitely here to buy.

408
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,240
That girl could lead to
wherever Ghovat is staying.

409
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,800
I'll have Jones keep tailing them.

410
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,660
Hey, man, for the record, you're
much scarier than that other guy.

411
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,260
Much.

412
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,050
Looks like your boy Dmitri is
heading into a hotel on Madison.

413
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,730
Think he's staying there?

414
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,780
Well, he ain't bringing any
luggage with him.

415
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,910
Lock it down. Put somebody
on every exit. I'm on my way.

416
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,570
Gotcha.

417
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,910
- Anything?
- No.

418
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,040
He's been in there for... two hours.

419
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,370
- Nobody in or out?
- No, and I got two agents on every exit.

420
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,130
This is Burke.

421
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,070
Got a report of two
men arguing on the 50th floor.

422
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,970
Dmitri's on the 50th floor.

423
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,090
- Jones, get that room.
- Okay.

424
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,760
Damn it.

425
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,720
Sex games gone wrong?

426
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,490
No. Could just be a message.

427
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,660
- Maybe he was trying to shut him up.
- Yeah, but we don't even know if Ghovat was here.

428
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,040
No, our ghost was here.

429
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:33,550
The knife wound matches the blade width and angle of
penetration on our foreign national killed by Ghovat.

430
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,410
It's him.

431
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,050
Do we know how Ghovat
got out of the building?

432
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,010
Yeah. Found a service
elevator down the hall.

433
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,020
Wasn't on the reconstruction blueprints.

434
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,460
Which is exactly why
he picked this place.

435
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,830
Yeah, this guy is good.

436
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,040
Why a dress?

437
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't know. It's
not off-the-rack.

438
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,300
There's no tag, which means it's couture.

439
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,880
We deal with a lot of knockoffs.

440
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,840
Ask me what I know about
a Prada bag sometime.

441
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,670
Oh, look at this.

442
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,640
There's a slit here.

443
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,750
It's about the size of an
electronic security strip.

444
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,040
A lot of the designers
are building them into the clothes.

445
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,930
So, basically, it's a
miniature flash drive?

446
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,530
Yeah, in theory, you could piggyback
up to 4 gigs on one.

447
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,410
Well, that's enough space to smuggle all
kinds of information worth killing for.

448
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,800
Lauren, uh... give me a photo book of all
the designers who had a show this year.

449
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,590
Let's find out who made this dress.

450
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,100
I don't know who this Ghovat is.

451
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,060
You don't know his name? Hmm?

452
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,730
Not even by rumor?

453
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,400
My world is fashion.

454
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,080
We both know we're not
talking about fashion.

455
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,640
I have a show this evening I
must be prepared for.

456
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,050
That's on hold.

457
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,890
- You have no reason for any of this.
- Actually, I do.

458
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,630
Can you explain why one of your
designs showed up at my murder scene?

459
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,960
You're the police. You tell me.

460
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,520
Whatever you did resulted in
the death of two people.

461
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,480
And if I didn't do it, my
son would be dead also.

462
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,980
All right, what happened?

463
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,290
A few hours before my team and
I are to leave tel Aviv,

464
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,610
my wife calls, tells me
that they have my son.

465
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,180
Ghovat kidnapped your child?

466
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,990
And then I was told to clear my
shop and wait for instructions.

467
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,990
And then he showed up, told me I had
to smuggle something into the states for him.

468
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,400
What was that something?

469
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,730
All I know is that it was in the dress.

470
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,650
That's it.

471
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:04,820
After we cleared U. S. Customs, I heard
from my wife that my son is returned to us.

472
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,680
All right, look, two people are dead because
of whatever you helped bring in the country.

473
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,700
Is there anything you
can tell me about it?

474
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,430
Well... ... I can show you the real dress.

475
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,610
That's it.

476
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,360
I always make two dresses.

477
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,220
I didn't tell him he took the wrong one.

478
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,960
That makes sense.

479
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,350
Dmitri shows up to get the dress from
Ghovat and finds out it's a fake.

480
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,970
They struggle, Ghovat
manages to make it out alive.

481
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,330
So why kill him and bring all that heat?

482
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,610
He's trying to salvage the deal but can't if Dmitri is
running around telling everybody the technology is no good.

483
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,390
What do you think is on this thing?

484
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,010
Could be launch codes, covert I. D. , The
formula for new coke -who knows?

485
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,950
But our technology guy swill have an
answer for us by tomorrow morning.

486
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,870
I don't know. Something that valuable - there's
no way Ghovat's gonna pack it up and go home.

487
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,930
I've got a thought.

488
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,210
Let's take our thread and go fishing.

489
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,370
How could you be so stupid?

490
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,890
Ghovat, please, you have to believe me.

491
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,730
I didn't know what you wanted me to do.

492
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,340
You - you didn't
want me to know.

493
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,270
Where's the dress now?

494
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,920
It's gone. I sold it.

495
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,200
You sold the dress?

496
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,350
My dress?

497
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,600
Someone made an offer ahead of the show.

498
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,540
He bought it for his fiancé.

499
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,490
How much did he pay?

500
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,850
$50, 000.

501
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,660
Who did you sell it to?

502
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,250
How long will we have to keep this up?

503
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,080
Just long enough to get
noticed. You're doing great, Tara.

504
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,680
I'll be doing better once this is over.

505
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,620
That dress really does
look fantastic on you.

506
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,630
If only I could wear it on a runway.

507
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,010
There's nothing to say you won't someday.

508
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,590
Can I get you a drink?

509
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,150
- New watch?
- Yeah.

510
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,610
Excuse me, sir?

511
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,010
This just arrived for you.

512
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,120
Hello?

513
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,920
I recognize you from the party.

514
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,250
- Who is this?
- I saw you steal Dmitri's phone.

515
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,360
Yeah, I was trying to
eliminate the competition.

516
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,980
Guess it worked.

517
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,050
So you know what you have?

518
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,750
I know exactly what I got.

519
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,450
You paid $50, 000for the
dress. I'll give you$5 million.

520
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,040
Aw, my fiancé loves it so
much, how about we make it 10?

521
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,670
Do you know who you're talking to?

522
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,210
- This is Steve, right?
- I tried to be nice.

523
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,320
I tried to give you a choice.

524
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,310
Nothing on the phone.

525
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,750
It's a burner.

526
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,350
You can pick up one of
these at any corner deli.

527
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,840
Prints?

528
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,380
It's clean.

529
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,100
- Agent Burke
- What's up?

530
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,220
We had two plain clothes taking Tara home.

531
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,060
Somebody got to
them about a half-hour ago.

532
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,360
Got to them how?

533
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,860
Blasted the car to hell.

534
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,200
Fortunately, our guys were wearing vests.

535
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,180
- What about Tara?
- They grabbed her, got away clean.

536
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,640
I have your girl.

537
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,900
What's the dress worth to you now?

538
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,110
So, now what?

539
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,260
You want the girl, I want the dress.

540
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,860
Trade?

541
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,070
Where and when?

542
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm not interested in meeting with you.

543
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,100
Then who?

544
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,570
Agent Peter Burke.

545
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,690
Why him?

546
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,310
Because it's really the
FBI that holds the dress.

547
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,250
Is he there now?

548
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,030
It's for you.

549
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,750
This is Burke.

550
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,960
Yes, I'm sure you
heard everything earlier.

551
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,810
You want me to make the exchange.

552
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,610
That's right. I won't waste my
time telling you to come alone.

553
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,270
Just make sure to bring the real dress.

554
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,080
If it's not, are you
gonna make me eat it?

555
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,520
That's funny. Keep this phone on you.

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,940
You'll meet me at the central park
band shell tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 P. M.

557
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,660
Plenty of time for you to
get your men into position.

558
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,810
You have to let me go to the exchange.

559
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,440
It's my fault Tara is in trouble.

560
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,350
I'm the one who paraded
her around town in that dress.

561
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,130
The best thing you can do is help me
figure out what Ghovat's game plan is.

562
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,400
He knows we're gonna
have the place staked out.

563
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
He knows you're running a playbook.

564
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,070
Right, so I'm gonna toss the
old one, come up with a new one.

565
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,260
No. No, you don't. That's the point.

566
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,080
See, he's counting on
the FBI to have a plan.

567
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,630
So I do nothing?

568
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,140
Go with him.

569
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,350
Like you would?

570
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,130
If he expects you to
have a plan, don't have one.

571
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,350
Oh, that's the worst idea ever.

572
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,000
Prepare all you can. Just
know it's all gonna change.

573
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,570
What would you do?

574
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,480
Go home and have dinner with my wife.

575
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,230
You meet this guy in central park and you
give him the dress and he gives you the girl?

576
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,550
That's about the size of it.

577
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm re ally glad you got into the white-collar crime
division, where nothing exciting happens.

578
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,860
It's -it's
pretty dull stuff.

579
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,450
Yeah.

580
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,670
Um, I got you another present.

581
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,130
Honey, not another one.

582
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,660
I-I'm enjoying my first one. Don't...

583
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,790
it's my old watch.

584
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,550
But I-I-I-I
love my new one.

585
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,400
Come on, honey, it's - it's big, it's
clunky, it moves around your wrist, and -

586
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,840
I mean, it's beautiful, but...
it's not you.

587
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,830
Take this.

588
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,260
I need you to be agent
Peter Burke tomorrow.

589
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,300
And this -
this is you.

590
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:11,480
Besides, um, when all this is over with, I
need you home at 6:00right on the dot.

591
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,060
Thank you.

592
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,760
And Ghovat wants the dress because
it's been tagged with a security device.

593
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,280
We cracked the thread this morning.

594
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,780
It's holding the holographic code
of the latest European currency seal.

595
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,360
We're using a counterfeit code. We're hoping
he won't be able to tell the difference.

596
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,830
But if he does, this could go south fast.

597
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,740
We're putting this girl's life at risk.

598
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,490
We could put the entire
monetary system of Europe at risk.

599
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,910
Guess who wins.

600
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,830
I'll be running point - we've have eyes
in the air, plainclothes on the ground.

601
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,090
Cruz, Jones, you're with me.

602
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,000
Burke, you know what you got to do.

603
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,890
Caffrey, put your hand down.

604
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,630
Put it down!

605
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,240
I'm just wondering where I'll be.

606
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,640
On a coffee run. You're not
even supposed to be here.

607
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,430
Any questions?

608
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,160
Then let's get into position.

609
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,060
- Are we good to go?
- We are good.

610
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,710
Okay, people, let's do this.

611
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,900
Can I come in?

612
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,290
Get in here!

613
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,150
Close the door.

614
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,990
You're right on time.

615
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,030
I like to be punctual.

616
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,370
Well, that's one thing we have in common.

617
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,140
I don't see you.

618
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,320
Of course you don't.

619
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,940
He's signaling us.

620
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,630
555-3147.

621
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,340
He's giving us Ghovat's incoming
phone number. Get me a trace.

622
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,610
Yep, I'm on it.

623
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,270
Good, Peter.

624
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,450
How do I know you have the girl?

625
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,430
I want to hear her voice.

626
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,170
Agent Burke?

627
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,180
Tara, are you okay?

628
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,390
Bethesda fountain. That's 300 yards.

629
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,730
You've got one minute.

630
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,590
If I see any of your agents or
unmarked vehicles move, the girl's dead.

631
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,630
Your time starts... now.

632
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,560
Everyone stay where you are! Stay down!

633
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,950
Everybody hold their positions.

634
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,920
We still got him on GPS, right?

635
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,490
Yeah.

636
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,570
- Just stay down! Stay down! Stay there!
- Standing down.

637
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,680
Go get the dress.

638
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,440
If you'll notice, agent Burke, I've added a little fashion
accessory of my own to our model friend here.

639
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,380
The belt is lined with plastique.

640
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,860
I dial a number here...
and she goes "boom.

641
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,970
" Give her the dress.

642
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,290
Toss it.

643
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,400
Please don't try anything.

644
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,970
I have five bar sand free long distance.

645
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,600
I can be far away and
still cause you pain.

646
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,630
Let him walk.

647
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,170
Even if he's bluffing, we
can't take the chance.

648
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,640
Yes?

649
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,770
Hey, is this Steve?

650
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,430
What's up, buddy? You never call.

651
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,180
Son of a bitch.

652
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,800
All right, keep calling. Jam his
phone so he can't trigger the bomb.

653
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,270
Keep calling him!

654
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,850
Hey, Cruz... stay with Caffrey.

655
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,760
Everybody else, keep dialing.

656
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,340
Jam the phones!

657
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,660
Keep calling him!

658
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,370
We're jamming his call. Get
the belt off of her.

659
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,580
Do it, do it!

660
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,270
Come on. Hold still.

661
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,560
Damn it.

662
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,550
Hey, Steve!

663
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,440
Now what?

664
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,150
That is pretty damn charming.

665
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,010
That's it. Good!

666
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,190
Everybody clear the area now!

667
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,670
Get down. Get down, get down!

668
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,380
You're actually doing the
whole hero thing.

669
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,550
Yeah.

670
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, they're gonna write
songs about this.

671
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,400
Nice.

672
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,360
You okay?

673
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,070
Area is contained. Bomb
squad is on the way.

674
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,690
I swept the leg. He went down.

675
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,130
- You did?
- Excellent.

676
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,010
You don't look dirty.

677
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,520
Yeah, well... I know what I'm doing.

678
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,450
It was nice of your FBI
friend to give you this.

679
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,050
There's no sound. Why
are you shushing me?

680
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,770
Okay.

681
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,590
Does she always wear
her hair parted that way?

682
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,340
Yeah, I'm way past that.

683
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,580
Wait.

684
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,850
Her scarf is forming the letter "M.

685
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,110
13th letter in the alphabet. 13 is a prime.

686
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,660
Thanks... rain man.

687
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,630
Do you want my help?

688
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,320
There it is. There it is.

689
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,190
How's your Morse code?

690
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:51,880
"b"... "o"... double "t"..."l"..."e".

691
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,750
"bottle"

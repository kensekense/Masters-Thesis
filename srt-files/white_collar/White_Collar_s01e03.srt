1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,120
Morning, sunshines.

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,680
Coffee.

3
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,380
What do we got? We got any headlines?

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,440
Not much, although they
keep bitching about his bible.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,870
Could be a debt ledger.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,730
Well, whatever it is, it's
missing, and they ain't happy about it.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,730
Hey, guys, we have a situation.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,450
Is that Barelli?

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,910
What's he doing down here?

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,610
I don't know, but it can't be good.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,540
That's Paul Ignazio, his
nephew. Here, turn the mike up.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,380
Damn his walking over here

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,610
You guys are the FBI, right?

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,820
We need your help.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,590
Last week, somebody walks into
my church...steals the bible.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,890
A bible?

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,580
An actual bible?

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,490
Yeah, you know - the flood, Abraham
sacrifices Isaac. You heard of it?

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,330
Why do you want our help?

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,930
I'm a taxpaying citizen.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
So? File a police report.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,740
Come on, Burke.

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,430
You got your guys sitting on me.

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,160
It's part of the game, I know, but it means that
I'm not free to...uh, find out who did this.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,760
Yeah, it means you're not
free to bust heads until you do.

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,440
Do I have to take these accusations?

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,160
Get to your point.

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,820
This bible -it's not just some book
that the Gideons leave on the nightstand.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,590
This - this is five
centuries of history from Naples.

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,430
The saints prayed over this book.

31
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,160
Your personal feelings for Barelli aside, I don't
need the archdiocese crawling down our necks

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,740
because we refused to
help recover a medieval bible.

33
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,280
Fine.

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,290
But if Barelli asked for our
help, he must really want it back.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
All right, let's get this straight, here.

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,840
You may go to confession once a
week, but the bureau doesn't forgive sins.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,980
We don't work for you.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,290
What do you want?

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,000
Shut down your book making operations
at Masso's club.

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,140
Masso's.

41
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,130
It's a restaurant.

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,010
See for yourself anytime...
after Thursday.

43
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,060
Please.

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,300
Please help me find my goddamn bible.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,770
Please stop.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,780
It's part of my process.

47
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,320
Look, either you taught her too
well, or it's just a bottle.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,210
It's more than that.

49
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,430
There's a message here.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,210
Hello?

51
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,810
Yeah, peter. I'll be down in 5.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,700
Oh, okay. I'm coming right now.

53
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,830
Oh, the man interferes yet again.

54
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,440
- Can you
please -yes.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,930
I'll take it back to
the lab, run some tests.

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,410
You don't have a lab. You
have a storage unit.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,350
Semantics.

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,110
Thanks, Moz.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
White collar - Season 01 - Episode 03

60
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:17,402
The bible belonged to the church of
saint Camillus De Lellis in Naples.

61
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,322
It was brought here in 1903.

62
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,022
It's been the heart of our parish.

63
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,662
Now this.

64
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:25,932
No alarm, no witnesses, no
sign of a forced entry.

65
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,962
It looks like a smash-and-dash.

66
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,482
Anything unusual that night, father?

67
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:33,032
No, not that I recall.

68
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,972
Have E.R.T. Run the prints
against the parish roster.

69
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,592
Something tells me
we'll get a few matches.

70
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:40,362
Nobody from this
parish stole that bible.

71
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:43,472
Oh, sure. You guys are all
choirboys, right, Barelli?

72
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:44,822
No surveillance cameras.

73
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,792
The lord sees all.

74
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,212
And that's good enough for us.

75
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:53,042
Maybe I'm getting my st. whatevers mixed up, but
didn't you used to run a soup kitchen here?

76
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,002
Not anymore.

77
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,022
Who steals a bible?

78
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,732
People steal everything.

79
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,532
Why would we steal one?

80
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,462
Just in theory. Uh, they're rare.

81
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,102
Yeah, it makes them
valuable, but not like a Picasso.

82
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:11,042
It's definitely niche markets.

83
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,932
Tough to fence.

84
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,972
People get weird about buying
stolen religious artifacts.

85
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:20,062
I think it's an irony thing -
that pesky eighth commandment.

86
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,952
Yeah, thou shalt not steal.

87
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:23,862
Well, it depends what's
important to people.

88
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:29,672
Did you know that an original "Star
Trek" dome lunch box goes for 600 bucks?

89
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,142
I don't try to explain it.

90
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:34,142
No, I-I can appreciate
that, but why this one?

91
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:35,922
Well, your missing book is famous.

92
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,992
It's known as the healing bible.

93
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,362
Really? Attribution.

94
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:44,012
I-in 1588, the plague
passed through Naples.

95
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:48,582
Father Camillus carried the book into
disease-stricken ships in the harbor.

96
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,442
Not a single person who
touched the bible died.

97
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:52,292
Good story.

98
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:57,472
20 years later, a blind girl regained her
sight when she rescued the book from a fire.

99
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,192
I could give you many more examples.

100
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:02,102
No, I-I'm sure you could.

101
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:06,322
Look, maybe you don't
steal it for the money.

102
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,682
Maybe you steal because
you're a true believer.

103
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:11,072
- True believer?
- You got something better?

104
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,872
Every person in that
church has a felony record.

105
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:16,042
The only people I don't
suspect are the ones in prison.

106
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:18,332
So, let's start with the faithful.

107
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,582
It cures blind nuns and lepers.

108
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:23,862
Sounds like every
story in Sunday school.

109
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,332
Okay. Look at this.

110
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:31,122
In 1918, 30, 000 people in new
York died from the Spanish flu.

111
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:33,972
No one in this parish even caught a cold.

112
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:37,092
Maybe whoever took it thinks
it's gonna heal them.

113
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,492
It's worth looking into.

114
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,802
- Nobody in this church got the flu?
- It's true.

115
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:49,542
Why these guys and not the
church down the block?

116
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,322
Because of a book?

117
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,362
Tough to swallow.

118
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,312
- I thought you were catholic.
- Lapsed.

119
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,552
So you don't think some higher power
could have saved the congregation?

120
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,722
Oh, I'm more inclined to think they kept
the doors shut and loaded upon vitamin C.

121
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,502
Maybe god works with what he's got.

122
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,462
And god said, "shut thine
door sand eat thine oranges"?

123
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,212
Why not?

124
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:09,332
All right, look.

125
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:14,272
When they dug up king tut, everybody made such
a big deal out of the curse of the pharaoh.

126
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,722
Yeah, two dozen people who entered
the tomb ended up dead.

127
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:20,002
Yeah, they probably caught some
old bacterial infection.

128
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,422
Germs - there's your
divine intervention.

129
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,222
God can't use bacteria?

130
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:27,352
I prefer my miracles with a
little more smiting and lightning.

131
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,362
Priest:Can I help you?

132
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:30,952
Thanks for seeing us, father.

133
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,622
We wanted to run down one thing.

134
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:37,462
You didn't tell us your bible
was also known as a healing bible.

135
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,882
I didn't think it was relevant.

136
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,072
Could be.

137
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:44,762
Was there anybody in your church who is a true
believer of the healing power of the bible?

138
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,172
Someone who was terminally ill?

139
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:49,102
Someone who had a sick family member?

140
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,952
I was afraid this might happen.

141
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,682
What?

142
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,972
Mr. Barelli has discouraged the
homeless from the church.

143
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,472
He made you shut down the soup kitchen.

144
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,742
How Christian of him.

145
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:07,832
The night of the theft, I let a
homeless man sleep in the sanctuary.

146
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:09,152
His name's Steve.

147
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,372
Is he sick?

148
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,352
No. But someone very close to him is.

149
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:19,662
Steve?

150
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,852
Uh, my name is peter.

151
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,702
This is my friend Neal.

152
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,272
You mind if we ask you some questions?

153
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:34,962
The church you stayed in last
week - they're missing a bible.

154
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:37,042
You know anything about it?

155
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,042
Yeah, I-I took it.

156
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:44,132
Great.

157
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:45,622
We need it back.

158
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,622
No. No, i need it back.

159
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,562
What do you mean? Where is it?

160
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,152
I took it from the
church like he asked me to.

161
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:55,462
Now, he said that he would show
me how to help Lucy get better.

162
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:56,812
Then he took it from me.

163
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,162
Now, he has not brought it back.

164
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,892
Do you know where he is?

165
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,552
No. I wish I did.

166
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,702
Who asked you to take
the bible from the church?

167
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:08,122
Look, he said that he
would help Lucy get better.

168
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:11,012
She's not getting
better, okay? She's getting worse.

169
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,402
What's wrong with her?

170
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,642
She's tired all the time.

171
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,222
S-she don't eat nothing.

172
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,722
Now, if I could get that
bible back, she'll get better.

173
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:26,002
The man who asked you to take the
bible - did you meet him at the church?

174
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,562
Yeah.

175
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:35,492
Steve, if we showed you some pictures, do
you think you could recognize him?

176
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,212
We just need to get the bible back, okay?

177
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,972
'Cause she's fading, all right?

178
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,452
You okay to keep going?

179
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,812
What?

180
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,642
There's more of them?

181
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:02,192
Yeah. Let's, uh, just get
through this one, okay?

182
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:08,092
Glad we followed your hunch. I
hope it takes us somewhere.

183
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,452
O ye of little faith.

184
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,922
Been waiting all day to trot that one out, huh?

185
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:14,072
Been holding onto it since lunch.

186
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,902
Um, I'm gonna be right back, okay?

187
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:26,822
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah, "that bad" was about an hour ago.

188
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:33,022
Just give me the damn thing.

189
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:36,532
No luck, huh?

190
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,972
No, not -not
really, no.

191
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:43,032
Look, um...I'm sorry I'm
not more help to you.

192
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,242
My bell got rung pretty good in Fallujah.

193
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,332
You were in Iraq?

194
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,122
Yeah.

195
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,802
T-that's where I found Lucy.

196
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:58,872
We called in this predator
strike on this trigger house.

197
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:05,202
Two hellfires came in...
...and just destroyed everything.

198
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:08,792
Then I hear this little whimpering, so...

199
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:14,832
I lift up this piece of roof, and
there she was, just wagging her tail.

200
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:20,202
Well, you think you could
look at one more book?

201
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:21,592
Yeah.

202
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:25,722
Okay, the rest of you go over there, make
sure NYPD doesn't touch anything.

203
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,692
Let's go get peter.

204
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,382
What's going on?

205
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,882
- One of Barelli'sen just got shot.
- Who?

206
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,642
Paul Ignazio, Barelli's number two.

207
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:40,452
Barelli's nephew.

208
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:42,922
- That's him.
- Who?

209
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,712
That's the guy that
asked me to take the bible.

210
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,652
That's our boy.

211
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:09,802
Close range.

212
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,302
No eyewitnesses.

213
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,242
Body's not waterlogged, so it's...

214
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:16,472
fresh.

215
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:23,862
. 25-caliber casing. European gauge.

216
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,762
It's a . 22-caliber.

217
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:29,762
This is Brooklyn, buddy, not Bavaria.

218
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:31,822
Pete Burke.

219
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,472
This is a homicide, not an art
exhibit. What are you doing here?

220
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:38,082
Ruiz, I see they let
you out of your cubicle.

221
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:40,762
Yeah. This is my shore now.

222
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,702
Where's your pet convict?

223
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:44,772
I left him in the car with
the windows cracked.

224
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:46,412
What are you doing at my crime scene?

225
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,292
This tails into my case.

226
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,272
This is mob retaliation.

227
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,182
It's my investigation now.

228
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:54,942
You don't believe me, ask Hughes.

229
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,392
Don't -don't
start with me.

230
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,752
You've got ruiz running organized crime?

231
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:00,582
That's unbelievable.

232
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,332
We offer you that bump every
year. Every year, you turn it down.

233
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:04,822
This isn't
mob-on-mob.

234
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,842
The bible's the key to this thing.

235
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:12,672
All you got is a homeless guy with a spotty memory who
thinks Ignazio may have enticed him into stealing the bible.

236
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:17,922
What we got here is a dead member of the
Barelli family probably killed by the Morettis.

237
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,352
All right, fine.

238
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,042
I'll stay out of the
active investigation.

239
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,832
Just let me take a look at
whatever's on that body.

240
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:28,902
It's Ruiz's case, and he's not comfortable
sharing intel while Caffrey's with you.

241
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,612
- Oh, come on.
- He's a convicted felon, peter.

242
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:34,892
And Ruiz isn't the only
one with reservations.

243
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:40,672
- All right,
- well...plenty of other cases on your sheet.

244
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:42,712
Let organized crime handle this one.

245
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:49,862
We're off the case. We've
been asked to step down.

246
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:56,402
You think this is a
retaliation killing by the other family?

247
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:02,392
I don't think Paul would have met a Moretti alone by
this river, not with all the bad blood in the water.

248
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,652
- Now, if Ruiz is right...
- that a Moretti killed him?

249
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,482
We may be sitting on
the edge of a mob war.

250
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,812
So, what do we do?

251
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:12,472
I can't do much of anything.

252
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:15,372
Ruiz is not willing to
share the case file.

253
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:16,862
So, where's that leave us?

254
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:20,572
Like I said, i can't do much of anything.

255
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:28,842
I'm getting a little chilly by
this water, aren't you?

256
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:30,752
Think I could borrow your jacket?

257
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:34,792
I swear to you, peter, under no
circumstance swill I impersonate the FBI.

258
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,442
Where do you think you're going?

259
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,382
This is Paul ignazio's apartment, right?

260
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:50,652
Hi, uh, Ted Jefferson from
the evidence recovery team.

261
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:52,832
I don't care if you're thomas
Jefferson. I need I. D.

262
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,202
Oh, sorry.

263
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,942
I pulled a double-hommy last night.

264
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:01,002
It's in the van.

265
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:04,222
My partner took it to
see his girlfriend in queens.

266
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:06,412
Not my problem, brother.

267
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,382
Look, I just need a urine
swab from the Vic's toilet.

268
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,972
If I don't get it soon, it'll spike
the cross-reactivity, and then -

269
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:16,162
I got orders, too, pal. No I. D. , No pee.

270
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:21,162
Oh, I know. You can get it.

271
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:23,272
It's easy.

272
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:28,492
All you got to do is swab around the rim of
the toilet, then drop the swab into the tube,

273
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:31,302
screw the cap on the
tube, and, bam, we're good to go.

274
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:33,022
No way. I'm not doing that.

275
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,292
Okay.

276
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:39,312
Now it's your problem.

277
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:46,212
- Yeah, cap. I got a local hero by
the name of - okay, okay, pee boy.

278
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:49,002
- Get it yourself.
- Oh, it turns out the hero's on our side.

279
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,252
Never mind.

280
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,212
Any problems getting in?

281
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,362
None. He thinks I'm swabbing toilets.

282
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,072
I figure we've got about 10
minutes until he gets curious.

283
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,332
Why, is that the
standard toilet-swabbing time?

284
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:04,632
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

285
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,032
You know, you look pretty
comfortable in that FBI windbreaker.

286
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,022
Maybe it's time to
consider a new career path.

287
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,912
Nope. I prefer to keep my soul.

288
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:12,012
What are we looking for?

289
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,052
Paul convinced our homeless
guy to steal a bible.

290
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:17,632
I want to know why, I want to know who killed
him, and I want to know if they're related.

291
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,572
He was researching something.

292
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:26,592
Hundred years' war, the crusades.

293
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:29,432
Illuminated manuscripts.

294
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,352
Illuminated...-

295
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,902
do you know the name maria Fiametta?

296
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,912
Doesn't ring a bell. Who is she?

297
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,922
Art historian, Brooklyn state.

298
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:01,642
Serendipity - Paul had an
appointment at Brooklyn state.

299
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:03,672
You find anything?

300
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:06,412
Neal:Your hunch was right. Ruiz
is on the wrong trail.

301
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,072
And how did you learn this?

302
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,572
- A friend. The same
friend who - same guy.

303
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,922
He's real. I'm not making him up.

304
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,692
Oh, I know he's real.

305
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,132
How much do you know?

306
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,772
Enough. What'd you find?

307
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,202
A professor who writes about
the black market -

308
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:25,962
Sicilian grave robbers, Egyptian
smugglers, and Serbian mobsters.

309
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,392
I mean, you can't run with those crowds unless
you're willing to get dirt under your nails.

310
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:33,022
- What's his name?
- Her name is maria Fiametta.

311
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,462
A woman.

312
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:37,232
A regular "Cindiana" Jones.

313
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,132
- Do you want Togo meet her?
- Yeah, I think I do.

314
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,832
You gentlemen are with the FBI?

315
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:51,342
Yes, we're hoping you can
help us out on this one.

316
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,222
We're working on a stolen bible.

317
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,422
Show her.

318
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,312
Thank you, agent...?

319
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,052
Neal Caffrey.

320
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:04,002
That's funny. There's a very talented manuscript
forger also named Neal Caffrey.

321
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:06,842
How talented?

322
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,972
You're him.

323
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:11,222
And you're with the FBI?

324
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:14,162
It's...sort of a work release.

325
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:18,712
I have to ask - um, is it true
that the Vinland map is yours?

326
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:20,412
How could it be?

327
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:22,412
But if it is a forgery, it's spectacular.

328
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,802
How about we get back to
my current problem?

329
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:29,042
A pre-renaissance bible
stolen from a church in Brooklyn.

330
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:37,732
It's...very beautiful, but
it's not a bible.

331
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:38,902
It's not?

332
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:42,882
Pre-renaissance, yes, uh, but
it's too small to be a bible.

333
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:45,172
Then it's a book of hours.

334
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:48,742
Most likely, yes. In the Italian style.

335
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:50,062
It's a large prayer book.

336
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:55,742
To show their devotion, monks and nuns had to recite the
psalms, hymns, or chants at specific times all day long.

337
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,842
- Sunday school.
- Lots of Sundays.

338
00:18:57,892 --> 00:19:00,062
This is a particularly nice example.

339
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,412
Paul Ignazio thought so, too.

340
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,972
- Sorry?
- Do you know him?

341
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,402
- No.
- We believe he stole it.

342
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:09,942
Oh, well, I hope you catch him.

343
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,352
Can't -
he's dead.

344
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:16,212
Looks like a mob hit, but we're still
hoping to figure out who took the book.

345
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:19,322
I'd love to know. It's quite beautiful.

346
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:22,222
Here's my card. If you hear
anything or come across anyone

347
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:25,342
- who's looking to buy or sell something like that...
- I will call you.

348
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,992
- Thank you
- It's a pleasure.

349
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,782
If you are ever in the mood to
discuss medieval manuscripts -

350
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:34,252
oh, you'd be surprised how
often I'm in the mood for that.

351
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:51,672
Was this just an
exercise in schadenfreude?

352
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,202
Because you win. It's just a bottle, man.

353
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,672
The lab needs to re-examine its work.

354
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,602
The lab went over every
inch of that thing.

355
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:02,902
Fingerprints, chemicals, black
light - nothing.

356
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,352
I even tested the remnants of the
wine left in the bottle, which,

357
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:11,142
by the way, was a very lovely
boxed franzia from early October.

358
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,572
Oh, your FBI friend keeps
you on a tight leash.

359
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:21,662
All right, look, keep
looking, Moz. Something's there, okay?

360
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,832
She's lying about Paul, and she's two degrees away from our homeless guy,

361
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:36,122
but I also have trouble buying the fact that
an attractive history professor offed a mobster.

362
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:40,052
No, you don't want me to see the missing
inventory because if I come down there,

363
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:42,192
there's gonna be a lot
more missing than centerpieces.

364
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,422
You got that?

365
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,822
Okay, maybe it's not a complete stretch.

366
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,462
Hey, guys.

367
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,102
Sorry. Um, it was just my vendor.

368
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:51,822
No, it's fine.

369
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,822
We were just trying to decide if
a woman is capable of murder.

370
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,142
Oh, I think so.

371
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,992
What's the issue?

372
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,862
I-I think we're
dealing with a shell game.

373
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,842
Visual aids. Nice.

374
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,752
Big gulp is Paul, dead mob guy.

375
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:12,582
Coffee cup is Steve, our homeless vet.

376
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,832
Mug is maria.

377
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,672
Napkin's the bible.

378
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:18,122
Make maria the saltshaker.

379
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,832
Maria's the mug. Watch.

380
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:22,172
We'll start with
Paul, who, for some reason,

381
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:26,502
reads maria's book and realizes that the
healing bible is worth a hell of a lot of cash.

382
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,472
But it's also Barelli's pride and joy.

383
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:33,152
He doesn't want to risk Barelli's wrath, so
he gets...Steve to steal the bible.

384
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,932
Plausible deniability.

385
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:38,532
But if it doesn't work, then he
let's the homeless guy take the fall.

386
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,022
Well, that's evil.

387
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:44,032
Takes the bible from Steve, calls maria
to make the deal. Something happens.

388
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:49,272
Yeah, the deal goes down wrong, or Paul
decides he wants both the cash and the book.

389
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:56,082
Well, whatever it is, Paul ends up dead, the
bible goes missing, Steve never even met maria.

390
00:21:56,162 --> 00:22:00,462
And our girl walks away
clean with a very expensive book.

391
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:04,042
Okay, how'd you do that?

392
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,142
Never reveal your secrets.

393
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,582
Well, how do we get maria to reveal hers?

394
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:12,972
Well, if I stretch it, I might be able
to get a warrant to get into her place.

395
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,942
You know, if she's smart. She's not gonna
have that bible anywhere close to her.

396
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:19,582
El, I've never seen this devious side.

397
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:21,022
Don't cross me.

398
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,982
Elizabeth's right about the
bible. She won't keep it close.

399
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:27,832
I've got it. She knew who you
were -Neal Caffrey, master forger.

400
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:30,142
- Alleged.
- Alleged. Whatever.

401
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,112
If she's got the book, it
links her to the murder.

402
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:34,572
She's gonna want to get rid of it.

403
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:39,362
We've got all the usual channels locked
down, but if she thinks you might be interested...

404
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,692
convince her I'm pliable.

405
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:45,082
We find some street contacts, float it out
that old Neal Caffrey is back in business.

406
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:47,722
No, that could take time to reach
her, and there's no guarantee.

407
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:50,422
Why don't you just ask her out?

408
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:53,392
That could work. Think she'll say yes?

409
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,682
- Yes. - I
could prob-

410
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,952
to history, old and new.

411
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:08,182
How does an FBI agent get a table
here? It's like a six-month wait.

412
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,642
Oh, an FBI agent doesn't.

413
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,762
Don't forget -I
had a previous life.

414
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,462
Oh, yeah.

415
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:17,192
Do you believe in reincarnation?

416
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:19,732
You could say that.

417
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,092
How about you?

418
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,032
Who were you in your previous life?

419
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:26,102
Same person I've always
been...with '90s hair.

420
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:30,102
I doubt that.

421
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,122
- Let me see your lifeline.
- No.

422
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:34,092
Come on, it'll - it'll
help fill in the blanks.

423
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:37,742
You're not seriously gonna
read my palm right now, are you?

424
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,362
Calluses.

425
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,652
Not afraid to get dirty.

426
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,422
Well, that's true.

427
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:45,712
What else?

428
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:51,132
No ring. Between that and the calluses, I'm
guessing work gets in the way.

429
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:56,242
Not a ring for you, either.

430
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:59,672
Yeah. Prison got in the way.

431
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:05,472
So, it must be weird for
you -working for the FBI.

432
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,992
I don't know.

433
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,532
It's always interesting to read
from the other team's playbook.

434
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,702
The other team? I thought you
were out of the game.

435
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,212
Oh, I am.

436
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:15,512
Retired and rehabilitated.

437
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:19,502
Have you found your missing bible?

438
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,102
Not yet.

439
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,542
You know anyone who wants to buy one?

440
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,412
Maybe.

441
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:33,642
Looters approach me all the time. So
do buyers. It's a very attractive offer.

442
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,822
It sure is.

443
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,952
- Uh, judge Rattigan faxed the warrant.
- Excellent.

444
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:46,242
All right, Neal's got orders to keep her
away from her home for at least an hour.

445
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:47,712
- Can you bypass the alarm?
- Two minutes.

446
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:49,482
Let's do it.

447
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:53,042
- Surprise me.
- Oh, you sure?

448
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,702
I might order something you don't
like, and then where would we be?

449
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:59,102
I trust you.

450
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:03,142
After all, you work for the FBI.

451
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:06,612
More wine?

452
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,722
Now you read minds?

453
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,552
The question is, do you?

454
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:18,792
Clinton: It's not bad for
a college professor, huh?

455
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:22,012
Yeah, well, she's either a
crook or a trust-fund baby.

456
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,732
Yeah, maybe it's both.

457
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:27,572
- They usually are.
- Nice catch.

458
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,272
Yeah, not a bad place to
drop a bug, either.

459
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:33,932
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's good
coverage. Let's do it.

460
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:39,462
She's bringing him back here for dessert.

461
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,832
Of course she is.

462
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,082
Oh, you jealous you
ain't getting any of it?

463
00:25:46,182 --> 00:25:48,172
Neal? No.

464
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:51,502
I'm perfectly fine with the stale-ass coffee I have in the van, thank you.

465
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,772
- Good?
- Yeah, we're good.

466
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:57,972
Careful, Lauren. Don't
spill that stale-ass coffee.

467
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:01,402
It's a bug. I can hear.

468
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,992
They're home. Roll tape.

469
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,632
After you.

470
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:10,182
Some wine?

471
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:12,012
Why not?

472
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:19,032
So...what shall we talk about?

473
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:24,432
There's this story about these two
spies, a French duke and an Italian count.

474
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:28,582
They're sworn enemies who spent the
whole year trying to trick each other,

475
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:33,652
but on new year's eve, they got to ask one
question that the other had to answer truthfully.

476
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:34,772
Yes.

477
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:39,632
The trick was asking the right question
because you may never get another chance.

478
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:44,902
I've always said honesty is
a more challenging game.

479
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:47,412
"Honesty is a more challenging game"?

480
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,682
Geez, how come my
dates don't go like this?

481
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:52,762
Because you don't say things
like, honesty is a more challenging game.

482
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:54,762
That's because nobody actually talks like that.

483
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,312
They do in Neal Caffrey's world.

484
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,752
This wine needs to breathe.

485
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:01,492
I'm gonna get a decanter.

486
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,012
Why don't you put some music on?

487
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:32,432
What are you in the mood for?

488
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:37,802
- Oh, you know...
- surprise you.

489
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:48,878
10 years painting the same bible.

490
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,738
It's like stalking god.

491
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:54,948
If it weren't for the monk's
devotion, we would have lost one

492
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:58,968
of the most significant works
of Greek literature forever.

493
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:02,118
Stunning.

494
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,438
I agree.

495
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,048
You know what?

496
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,728
I don't trust you.

497
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:15,728
Smart.

498
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:18,408
I wouldn't trust me, either.

499
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,818
I think we have a technical problem.

500
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:30,158
That's one way of putting it.

501
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,548
Let's play the spies game.

502
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,558
- I'll ask you a question...
- and I have to tell you the truth?

503
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,138
And you have to tell me the truth.

504
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,888
Okay. Make it a good one.

505
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,368
Which Neal caffrey are you?

506
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:58,328
Are you working for the good guys...
or are you working a bigger game?

507
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,888
What happened?

508
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:17,738
Neal happened.

509
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,938
Did I answer your question?

510
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:22,158
Maybe.

511
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:28,018
The feds linked Barelli's bible to Paul Ignazio, and
you to Paul through his visits to the college.

512
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:32,898
Look, maria, I'm living proof. If
the feds want something from you,

513
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:35,618
they'll turn your
life inside out to get it.

514
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:37,698
They'll tell Barelli you have his book.

515
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:40,018
Even if I don't?

516
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:48,828
I can get you $250, 000in two days.

517
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:50,628
It is worth a lot more than that.

518
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:53,768
Not if you're in prison or dead.

519
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:56,878
Between the FBI and the
mob, there's no way you can move it.

520
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:58,568
I can.

521
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:01,608
The other team's playbook.

522
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:06,618
If I shouldn't risk it, why are you?

523
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:09,578
Won't they send you back for good?

524
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:13,928
I'm already in prison.

525
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:16,528
We have a deal?

526
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:21,638
How did you know she was in on it?

527
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:23,768
Lucky hunch.

528
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:26,458
- Ruiz?
- I checked Paul's credit.

529
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:31,908
He got wired 10 g's from a shell corporation
in Gibraltar owned by your lady professor.

530
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:36,268
Oh, by the way, how'd last
night's fishing go? Get any tape?

531
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:40,978
Equipment failure. But
Caffrey says she has the book.

532
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,148
She'll sell, but only to him.

533
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,168
Of course he'd say that. The terms?

534
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:49,068
$250, 000 wired to a swiss account.

535
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:52,138
No way. What if he cuts a deal with
her, he runs away with the book?

536
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:54,508
- What choice do we have?
- We don't.

537
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:57,138
I don't need another dead body
washing up in the east river.

538
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:58,508
We'll set up a dummy account.

539
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,558
It's risky. What if she
takes a shot at Neal?

540
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:04,008
I wouldn't lose any sleepover it.

541
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:06,968
Morning, guys.

542
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,478
Everybody sleep okay?

543
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:14,248
Cayman's first national.

544
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:17,928
I'll e-mail you the
pin right before the buy.

545
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:23,798
First they're sending me back to prison, tomorrow they're giving
me a quarter million taxpayer dollars in an offshore account.

546
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:26,768
Guess that shows how
much confidence they have in you.

547
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:29,848
And how much I have in you.

548
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:40,868
Morning.

549
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,028
You're up early.

550
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:44,878
Couldn't sleep.

551
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,898
Big day.

552
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,298
I can tell.

553
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:50,538
You're wearing your lucky tie.

554
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:52,578
Hey, did you find the bible?

555
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,698
Yeah. The professor had it.

556
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:58,278
Neal's gonna buy it back.

557
00:31:58,298 --> 00:31:59,798
You're giving him money.

558
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,468
No wonder
-lucky tie.

559
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:06,028
No way. We set up a fake wire transfer.

560
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,658
Then what are you worried about?

561
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:14,478
He has to convince her that he's working
us, which means he has to cut his anklet for real.

562
00:32:14,608 --> 00:32:17,168
The book's worth a
fortune. He could run with it.

563
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:23,718
Well You have a lot more faith in
a ratty, old tie than you do Neal.

564
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:28,228
Yeah, well, this ratty, old tie's never
forged a priceless map of Vinland.

565
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:31,968
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that he'll do the right thing?

566
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:34,798
Let's just say that's
not his first instinct.

567
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:36,158
And trust isn't yours.

568
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:38,048
Occupational hazard.

569
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:40,468
I like to know I can count on something.

570
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,638
I know you do.

571
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:45,988
But sometimes you just
have to take a leap of faith.

572
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,618
Ruiz: Look at him.

573
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:59,508
Son of a bitch should be in
leg-irons if you ask me.

574
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,508
Nobody asked you, Ruiz.

575
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:03,628
He conned you, too, Pete, huh?

576
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,938
Here she comes.

577
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:14,198
We have a chaperon.

578
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:16,488
White van over my left shoulder.

579
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:32,608
What happened to not
mixing business with pleasure?

580
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:35,568
That's for us. He's patting her down.

581
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:38,378
I need a cigarette after that pat-down.

582
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,148
- You're clean.
- Thank you.

583
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:43,968
Your turn.

584
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,378
Well, what is that?

585
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,708
She making sure that's
not a gun in his pocket?

586
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,308
No bugs.

587
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:06,368
So Where's my money?

588
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,468
Where's my book?

589
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:14,658
You ready?

590
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,198
When I cut the anklet, our friends
in the van are gonna know I'm running.

591
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:19,748
Can you lose them? 'Cause
I'm not going back in.

592
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:24,548
-I've been chased by the carabinieri, drug
cartels in Bogotá * - I get it. You're good.

593
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:37,788
With all due respect, Neal...
we could make quite a fine pair.

594
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:41,138
With all due respect, maria, shut up and drive.

595
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:57,728
He cut the tracker.

596
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:59,288
Right on schedule.

597
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:01,348
- Oh, you knew about this?
- Of course.

598
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:03,348
He had to convince
her he's rigging the system.

599
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:04,328
What if he really is?

600
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,418
There are a dozen unmarked in the area.

601
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:08,928
NYPD has eyes in the sky.

602
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:10,978
There's nowhere to hide. Let's go!

603
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,348
I can't believe I'm doing this.

604
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,928
I spent a long time looking for her.

605
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,618
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

606
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:50,328
It's calfskin vellum. The
abyssus perfidia.

607
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:52,558
Golden chalice of Paul.

608
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:54,528
You satisfied?

609
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,678
Very.

610
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:07,388
***

611
00:36:08,448 --> 00:36:11,388
***

612
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:15,358
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

613
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:19,738
You'll never know how much
pleasure it could have been.

614
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:23,458
You know, I had a feeling all that
lovey-dovey stuff last night was B. S.

615
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,548
Next time you should
trust your instincts.

616
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,488
I did.

617
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,298
Clip. Lifted it when I patted you down.

618
00:36:30,408 --> 00:36:32,618
You forgot about the one in the chamber.

619
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:35,258
Damn it. I've never been a gun guy.

620
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,878
Give me the book, Neal.

621
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,518
Sorry.

622
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:42,238
You gonna take me on, it's
gonna cost you a small fortune.

623
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:43,768
What's the matter? You can't do it?

624
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,558
Is it 'cause of the money or the history?

625
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,838
- I think you know the answer to that.
- Is that why you killed Paul?

626
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:50,088
Paul decided that he
wanted the money and the book.

627
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:51,708
Yeah, that's what
happens when you get greedy.

628
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:55,098
Drop the gun!

629
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:00,198
Gun down or we shoot!

630
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:02,028
Put the gun down!

631
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:05,308
Right now -put the gun
down, your hands behind your head.

632
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,998
Man down. Man down!

633
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,248
Cut it a little close there, pal.

634
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:20,228
Guess the big guy had your back, huh?

635
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,668
Well, I'll tell you one
thing. You made Lauren's day.

636
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,308
Yeah, not Barelli.

637
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,148
How did you and your cub
scouts find out about this?

638
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,598
NYPD?

639
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,468
I got one of those police
scanners. It's a hobby.

640
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,668
**

641
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:42,248
She's Paulie's shooter?

642
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:45,108
Some kind of lover's quarrel?

643
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,288
Just business.

644
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:50,028
I hate to break it to you, but your nephew
decided to freelance behind your back.

645
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:53,238
Oh, that's sad, you know. You can't
trust family, who can you trust?

646
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:58,138
So, if you guys are done, I'd like my
bible back. Mass starts in one hour.

647
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:01,588
Would it kill you to say
thank you? Huh? Would it?

648
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:04,018
Yeah, I guess it would. All
right, just give it to him, man.

649
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,888
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

650
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:07,188
Give him the bible.

651
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,108
I gave it to some FBI guy.

652
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:11,028
"Some FBI guy"?

653
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,448
You think you can get over on me?

654
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:23,348
You'll wish you were never born, pal.

655
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,448
Yeah, I seem to be getting this
speech a lot lately.

656
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:28,888
- Just shut up.
- No,

657
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:32,518
no, I'm not gonna let this go.

658
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,608
Where is it, Caffrey?

659
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,758
I'll let Barelli give you a ride home.

660
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,948
Look, I'm telling you guys. I don't know.

661
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:43,998
I know where it is.

662
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:50,348
Hey, pally.

663
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,678
What are you doing with my bible?

664
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,918
She would have died without it.

665
00:38:57,508 --> 00:38:59,238
Not so fast, wacko.

666
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:00,998
You knowhow you're messing with?

667
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:03,338
You've got it, Barelli. Just
leave him alone.

668
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:05,768
No, I'm not gonna let this go.

669
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:08,868
Hey, sweet girl.

670
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,168
Her name's Lucy.

671
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:14,088
Lucky Lucy.

672
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,178
She don't look so good. What's
the matter with her?

673
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:20,188
She's been sick...until today.

674
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,118
I got this vet in Yonkers.

675
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:27,618
He saved my pugs from diabetes.

676
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,988
Want to take a ride, go see
him, have her checked out?

677
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:46,258
- I was gonna give it back after...
- I know.

678
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:48,038
How'd you know?

679
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:52,548
Okay, I didn't know, but I took a leap
of faith that you did the right thing.

680
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:55,108
- Elizabeth.
- Yeah.

681
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:57,458
I told you it's a healing bible.

682
00:39:57,598 --> 00:40:00,228
- Oh, here we go.
- No way.

683
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,878
Barelli's a softy for dogs.

684
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:04,328
Oh, not enough smiting and
lightning for you?

685
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:06,348
That's not a miracle.

686
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:10,428
Come on.

687
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:12,798
It's not a parting of the red sea.

688
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,498
Well, I'll take my
miracles where I can get them.

689
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:18,278
- Can we have the honors?
- Yes, sir.

690
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:24,178
She's back.

691
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,568
Hey, is that my jacket?

692
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,668
He works in mysterious ways.

720
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,300
Mozy, look at. Moz.

721
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,550
Mozy!

722
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,460
Let me see your warrant.

723
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,620
What?

724
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,620
Come here.

725
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,880
Lemon juice in the canlde.

726
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,400
How did I miss this?

727
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,810
- Weren't you ever a boy scout?
- Oh. I got kicked out.

728
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,520
Pinewood derby, magnets,
it was a whole... thing.

729
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,650
It's a map.

730
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,730
Of New York City subway.

731
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,330
What do you think it means?
